0.146,0.854,0.0,-0.34,the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place.

0.0,0.888,0.112,0.4404,i've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor.

0.063,0.937,0.0,-0.3612,"weaknesses are minor: the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so; it doesn't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names; you must cycle through every zoom setting (2x, 3x, 4x, 1/2x, etc."

0.084,0.763,0.153,0.998,"  this problem vanished after the first month, so i assume it was a temporary dust issue.

11_10	2.05	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist, and i discovered by accident (it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting.

11_11	-0.4	the remote is okay, but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons.

11_12	1.3	i especially like the more commonly used buttons, such as play, pause, and stop, to be larger and conveniently placed.

11_13	-0.15	while it is true that it will stand on end, it is also easy to knock over that way.

11_14	-1.45	i also didn't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode.

11_15	-0.05	the zoom goes up and down in magnification, which is nice, but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings.

11_16	-1.25	having spent considerable time with professional video gear, i find onscreen displays annoying.

11_17	0	i have not used the progressive scan feature.

11_18	0.55	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine.

11_19	2	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs, mine has run well, and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase.

11_20	-0.4	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor, along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support.

11_21	1.85	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4, i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it.

12_1	-3.3	do not buy this piece of junk.

12_2	-1.45	i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires.

12_3	-2.2	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do.

12_4	-1.35	i can only hear the sound.

12_5	-1.4	i changed video cables, tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help.

12_6	-0.8	i think you get what you pay for stands true.

13_1	-2	nice paperweight.

13_2	-2.15	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd's, after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it's job.

13_3	-2.15	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who doesn't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as (i believe) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked.

13_4	-2	as i emailed to the the customer service department, the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning.

13_5	-2.9	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality, or at least works.

14_1	-3.5	worst piece of electronics i ever bought.

14_2	-2.6	if i could give this a negative rating, i would.

14_3	-2.35	i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems.

14_4	-1.9	won't play a lot of discs.

14_5	-3.05	i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap!

14_6	-1.6	some movies it played yesterday, it won't play today.

14_8	-2.75	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent.

14_9	-2.45	amazon, do your customers a big favor, don't carry this item, and give them refunds!

14_10	-2.95	there should have been a recall on this product.

14_11	-2.55	fair warning - do not buy.

14_12	-2.6	i repeat - don't wast your money.

15_1	-3.1	don't buy!

15_2	-2.7	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work!

15_3	-2.25	it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working.

15_4	-2.25	one stopped working in february and the other in march.

15_5	-0.55	amazon has been working with me to refund my money, but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return.

15_6	-1.2	i have had great experience with amazon, but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems.

16_1	-1.8	we had problems.

16_2	-2.15	the dvd player does not work properly.

16_3	-1.75	the player usually plays dvd's, but has occasional problems such as: 1) not recognizing a dvd 2) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd.

16_4	-1	this has happened with several different dvd's and occasionally if we keep trying something, it will work when it did not work one time before.

16_5	-2.3	after we discovered the problems, we tried to contact apex (fkor 3 months), but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy, and they do not answer their web customer support.

17_1	0.05	ok if you have a 2nd dvd player.

17_2	0	i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now.

17_3	1.55	nothing has broken on it, and it plays all the dvds i have.

17_4	-1.65	unfortunately it can't play all of the dvd.

17_5	0	i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode.

17_6	-1.4	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd.

17_7	0	luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can't.

17_8	-1.75	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 couldn't play all my dvds, and now the player can't play everything.

18_1	-1.8	another person who had problem with picture after one use.

18_2	0.2	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband.

18_3	2.45	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great.

18_4	0.9	even viewed cds full of jpgs.

18_5	-1.2	we didn't get to use it again for over a month (sad, i know).

18_6	-1.75	but when we went to use it again, there was sound but no picture.

18_7	-2.25	we saw reviews that said the same thing, and also saw here that their customer service stinks.

18_8	-0.35	though we were past the deadline for returns (by a few days), i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help.

18_9	0.05	they authorized my late return, and hopefully they are giving apex heck.

18_10	-0.75	i hate apex but love amazon, and i tell everyone.

18_11	-2.8	do not buy this player.

18_12	-1.7	who knows how many uses you'll get out of it before it craps out, but it probably will.

19_1	-1.85	frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player!

19_2	-2.1	we've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work  apex "" dvd players and none worked."

0.0,0.784,0.216,0.5106,i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,now i know why - they are pieces of junk.

0.048,0.789,0.164,0.9974,"  this is the second apex dvd player i've had - and the last.

29_1	2.65	best player for the buck.

29_2	1.95	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd, but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper.

29_3	2.05	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal.

29_4	2.5	loved the slim design.

30_1	-1.5	black and white only after 1 month of use.

30_2	-1.35	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared.

30_3	-2	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy.

31_1	2.6	most bang for the buck.

31_2	3	i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent.

31_3	1.9	it plays all my back-ups, + or -, and everything else i have put in it without a hick up.

31_4	2.9	audio is excellent.

31_5	2.4	well worth the money.

32_1	2.45	for the price, an excellent buy.

32_2	1.3	after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player, i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected.

32_3	0.8	(good going, amazon).

32_4	2.6	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer.

32_5	0.7	so far i've played regular dvd's, backup dvd-r's, mp3 cd's, and regular cd's.

32_6	1.75	i have not yet tried the photo show capability, but i'm thinking that will probably work well too, based on the success with the above mentioned disks.

32_7	0.3	i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit.

32_8	-0.05	the comments i've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance, pushing the button to play pal (european type) movies, when an ntsc (usa type) movie disk is in the disk tray.

32_9	1.25	so, if you read the instructions well, you shouldn't have any problems with this dvd unit.

32_10	0.1	i can't speak to its long-term reliability, as i've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point.

32_11	1.3	but, it seems to work so well now, that i don't anticipate any problems with it.

32_12	2.15	bottom line for me is that for the price i don't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player.

33_1	2.55	excellent second dvd, or first dvd for hdtv ready tv.

33_2	2.6	wow!

33_3	1.4	simple to use and hook up.

33_4	0.3	comes with standard rca jacks for output, along with s-video output (s-video cable not included, must be purchased seperately) and also component video outputs.

33_5	2.1	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used.

33_6	1.65	i also own an  apex ad 1201 "" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent.

0.058,0.942,0.0,-0.2584,i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc's dvd-rom player.

0.03,0.773,0.197,0.8068,i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player.

0.0,0.744,0.256,0.4767,the second apex - at least it's prettier than the last.
0.0,0.783,0.217,0.5563,the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous (ad1100w) is most appreciated.
0.104,0.635,0.261,0.5719,"the prior one looked and felt lightweight, cheesy, and assembled by the oppressed:  i purchased it for it's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks."
0.17,0.758,0.072,-0.5719,"i used it lightly, and it lasted just over one year (forgot to kill the power one day, and now it only plays dvds)."
0.123,0.877,0.0,-0.2755,back to the 2600:  1.  it doesn't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive.
0.0,0.839,0.161,0.2755,2.  without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i've seen.
0.0,0.764,0.236,0.5719,"3.  excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer, panasonic, and jvc players."

0.0,0.778,0.222,0.7717,"anyway, the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product."

0.17,0.714,0.115,-0.25,what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds.
0.0,0.935,0.065,0.1027,"for example, i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd, but this dvd player can not read it."

0.367,0.633,0.0,-0.6381,"because of this, i am disappointed and would not recommend this product."
0.0,0.476,0.524,0.5106,apex you can trust.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i had apex regular (non-progressive) dvd-player for two years.

0.0,0.185,0.815,0.6588,a great discovery!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i bought this to replace an expensive ($ 300 +) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this has so many capabilities that you'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve.
0.059,0.634,0.307,0.7574,"i use this with a home theater system and it's amazing how it sounds, the picture clarity is unmatched!"

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player.
0.736,0.264,0.0,-0.4199,apex sucks!
0.307,0.693,0.0,-0.4767,only the cheap and poor would buy one.
0.524,0.476,0.0,-0.5106,video failed after 3 weeks.

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,quirky?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house.

0.0,0.517,0.483,0.8126,"the picture is clear, bright and sharp and the sound is good."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"again, though, it has only been used sparingly."
0.063,0.829,0.109,0.1531,"the catch is that, while it plays movies just fine, it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it's not a big deal for me.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i simply watched the extra features on another player.
0.172,0.828,0.0,-0.4019,"had this been my only dvd player, though, it would have been a real problem."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"as it is, i'm keeping the machine."
0.091,0.705,0.203,0.4019,"it works well enough (so far) for me to be satisfied with it, and it's possible that i'm missing something."
0.216,0.679,0.105,-0.5023,"but i would expect that, since my movie discs have all played with no problem, the extras discs would, too, without any additional tweaking."
0.179,0.513,0.308,0.25,i'm giving this player cautious recommendation.
0.0,0.737,0.263,0.3612,there are a lot of things i like about it.

0.106,0.705,0.188,0.3882,so far the dvd works so i hope it doesn't break down like the reviews i've read.
0.209,0.704,0.087,-0.6053,"prior to christmas, it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad!"

0.0,0.817,0.183,0.6808,the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties.
0.0,0.706,0.294,0.3612,but heck it plays my alias dvds.
0.0,0.833,0.167,0.34,what the heck is up with the 2600.  it suppose to play everything.

0.0,0.859,0.141,0.7506,"what can i say, i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever, quality design, stable, plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies."

0.0,0.765,0.235,0.5574,i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine.

0.099,0.809,0.092,-0.0516,there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open (my prev.

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"still, i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features!"

0.0,0.455,0.545,0.34,value for money.
0.0,0.888,0.112,0.34,this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it.
0.027,0.838,0.135,0.7906,"the plus points are -  1.  price  2.  ability to play most discs - i tried dvd, vcd, dvd-r, audio cd and it played all  3.  good looks  the downside -  1.  the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate, something that you wouldn't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel  2.  remote buttons are small and closely spaced, especially with the menu buttons."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed, i would rate this a 5 star machine."

0.0,0.865,0.135,0.5709,"i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy, i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera; and i must say, g3 worth every single cent i spent on it."
0.0,0.841,0.159,0.6486,"just a little overview, powershot g3 is the flagship of canon's powershot series and its an slr-like camera, its 4 megapixel and (alsmost) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance."
0.0,0.848,0.152,0.3612,"whether you are a novice or an expert, its ease of use and functionality goes together."
0.0,0.894,0.106,0.0772," + you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes, etc."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"as its 4mp, you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies (you can record 3 minutes of video)."
0.0,0.728,0.272,0.6249,i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast.
0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4404,"a good choice could be cf type ii, microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images."
0.26,0.74,0.0,-0.2755,some things that i didn't like (but hey.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,nothing is perfect).
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,* main dial is not backlit.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,* lens visible in optical viewfinder.
0.0,0.84,0.16,0.5859,(well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too.
0.0,0.575,0.425,0.5719,overall i'm happy with my toy.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,canon g3?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,incredible camera i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras.
0.038,0.75,0.212,0.7902,"a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful, as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made, plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"following my research, i decided on the g3."
0.0,0.661,0.339,0.6249,"in a word, "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera."
0.0,0.797,0.203,0.8732,"i won't go into the details here, as the online sites (stevesdigicams, dpreviews) go into great depth in their reviews, but i am very pleased with the features, the speed, the picture quality, the flexibility, the automation, and the functional conveniences this camera offers."
0.0,0.743,0.257,0.4791,"with the automatic settings, i really haven't taken a bad picture yet."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode, it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i am absolutely in awe of this camera, canon put enormous quality into the g3."
0.0,0.778,0.222,0.5505,"don't walk, run and buy this camera if you have the budget, i guarantee you will not be disappointed."
0.0,0.661,0.339,0.8016,great camera i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied.
0.0,0.814,0.186,0.4939,i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality.
0.0,0.799,0.201,0.7003,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features, and unlike many smaller digital cameras, it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,flaws?
0.096,0.904,0.0,-0.5416,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle, but since i use the lcd most of the time, this is not really much of a bother to me."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera.
0.066,0.657,0.278,0.6364,"despite this minor disappointment, i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography."
0.0,0.697,0.303,0.9161,haven't had practice but i'm already in love with it i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful.
0.0,0.664,0.336,0.7964,the photo quality is amazing and i know i'm going to have fun with all the features.
0.0,0.884,0.116,0.4144,"i've figured out most of its features on my own already (because i have used digital cameras before, so i know things like symbols)."
0.042,0.751,0.207,0.8037,"i'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top, but that doesn't stop me from loving this camera."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial.
0.044,0.956,0.0,-0.1689,"its very small and hard to turn so you can't get an accurate adjustment (for those of you who don't know what a diopter adjustment is, it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight.)"
0.0,0.834,0.166,0.5542,i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review.
0.024,0.614,0.361,0.9518,"excellent for the semi-serious amateur positives  1) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative, yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you don't want to bother with the settings."
0.0,0.463,0.537,0.7003,excellent range of metering options as well.
0.0,0.785,0.215,0.6249,it's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen.
0.0,0.892,0.108,0.7845,"2) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera (semi-serious amateur photographer)  3) 4x zoom is nice  4) the great thing about digital, in general, is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture, not two weeks later when you get the film developed."
0.0,0.761,0.239,0.2944,5) its focusing system is also very flexible.
0.036,0.89,0.074,0.3804,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button, and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus."
0.032,0.968,0.0,-0.1682,"negatives  1) quite bulky (it's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr) and uses a heavy battery, although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic (unlike canon's elph line)  2) not very ergonomical - you'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens)  4) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying."
0.0,0.523,0.477,0.8074,fantastic digital camera the camera has a wonderful set of features.
0.0,0.805,0.195,0.4404,the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd.
0.038,0.717,0.245,0.7956,the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry.
0.0,0.619,0.381,0.5719,the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect.
0.117,0.734,0.149,0.1918,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures (purple fringing, etc) so i am very pleased."
0.0,0.785,0.215,0.742,"the canon computer software used to download, sort, upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap (it is not very snug and can come off too easily) and the lens itself (it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd).
0.0,0.655,0.345,0.7003,the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use.
0.0,0.441,0.559,0.765,it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price.
0.0,0.611,0.389,0.8807,the best of everything recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available.
0.0,0.812,0.188,0.5719,newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box.
0.0,0.709,0.291,0.6249,4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome.
0.0,0.762,0.238,0.2924,don't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype.
0.0,0.874,0.126,0.0772,"unless you want to print murals, you don't need it."
0.0,0.648,0.352,0.7939,those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use.
0.122,0.761,0.117,-0.0258,"anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference."
0.0,0.886,0.114,0.2023,the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it's class.
0.0,0.796,0.204,0.3182,i expect the g3 will please me for years to come.
0.06,0.786,0.154,0.5411,pure class &amp; quality - a work of craftmanship i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period!
0.0,0.72,0.28,0.8979,"it gives great pictures, the controls are easy to use, the battery lasts forever on one single charge, the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing."
0.0,0.882,0.118,0.4939,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode.
0.0,0.233,0.767,0.5095,absolutely breathtaking.
0.0,0.876,0.124,0.5499,i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out.
0.097,0.903,0.0,-0.5594,"the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon, but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3."
0.0,0.762,0.238,0.3612,"i would recommend a larger compact-flash card, at least 128 mb."
0.0,0.745,0.255,0.6249,i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon.
0.0,0.773,0.227,0.6249,great camera what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you?
0.0,0.826,0.174,0.4877,"i make photographs at work, and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally."
0.0,0.853,0.147,0.3412,"at the same time, i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons."
0.107,0.893,0.0,-0.2023,"i recieved the camera, inserted a larger cf card, charged the battery, and handed it to my wife."
0.0,0.8,0.2,0.6114,"i showed her how to turn it on, where the lens zoom lever is, and she loves it!"
0.0,0.796,0.204,0.6249,"this camera has canon's great colorimetry, plus what you see in the lcd is what you get."
0.0,0.417,0.583,0.636,the prints are beautiful!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality.
0.069,0.931,0.0,-0.4767,"i tried out some other brands in the stores, and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company; plus what you see in the lcd (no optical finder) isn't what you get - not even for color; the output was less than i expected."
0.0,0.919,0.081,0.25,"although canon's batteries are proprietary, they last a really long time, recharge fairly quickly in the camera, plus if you want ' more power ', you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon."
0.0,0.637,0.363,0.8605,if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital this is a great camera for you!
0.0,0.854,0.146,0.6474,"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use."
0.0,0.592,0.408,0.8221,i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos!
0.0,0.756,0.244,0.6369,"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop, shutter speed and even focus."
0.075,0.623,0.302,0.8074,"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works, and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers."
0.402,0.598,0.0,-0.4003,warning - i did read the manual!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"but if you've used a slr 35mm camera, the controls are very intuitive!"
0.094,0.906,0.0,-0.34,once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located.
0.0,0.904,0.096,0.5267,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority (for high speed subjects), aperture priority (for focal length) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality."
0.0,0.892,0.108,0.4404,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options.
0.0,0.904,0.096,0.3054,it doesn't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can't access them quickly when you need them!
0.0,0.687,0.313,0.6249,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it.
0.0,0.839,0.161,0.3612,"you feel like you are holding something of substance, not some cheap plastic toy."
0.0,0.626,0.374,0.6989,"the more i work with it, the more i love it!"
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow!
0.0,0.738,0.262,0.69,i didn't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i'm thrilled with my purchase!
0.0,0.625,0.375,0.8016,"outstanding camera this is my first digital camera, and i am very pleased with it."
0.0,0.826,0.174,0.7227,"i do not know a whole lot about photography, but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform, even as i grow in skill and knowledge."
0.131,0.769,0.1,-0.1027,"seriously, this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want."
0.0,0.645,0.355,0.9206,"but at the same time, it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode, so that even an average joe like me can use it!"
0.0,0.423,0.577,0.6249,four megapixels is great.
0.0,0.872,0.128,0.296,"i know there are five mp cameras out there, but this thing does just fine for me."
0.0,0.942,0.058,0.0772,"if you want, check out the canon website and they have some sample images, taken by this camera, for you to download."
0.112,0.888,0.0,-0.34,"if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera, this is probably not what you are looking for."
0.0,0.818,0.182,0.6124,"if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex, this is it."
0.0,0.494,0.506,0.624,it is a very amazing product.
0.0,0.417,0.583,0.4201,i highly recommend it.
0.0,0.641,0.359,0.8555,love my new g 3 just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has.
0.0,0.351,0.649,0.5719,takes excellent photos.
0.0,0.658,0.342,0.3818,night mode is clear as day.
0.062,0.78,0.158,0.5158,"i have not played with all the features yet, but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it."
0.141,0.859,0.0,-0.204,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens.
0.231,0.769,0.0,-0.4019,"however, using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem."
0.0,0.656,0.344,0.6369,overall it is the best camera on the market.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i give it 10 stars!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,noise level this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the pictures are brillient i just bought the camera a few days ago.
0.11,0.782,0.108,0.221,"before i "" get used to it "", here are my first feelings:  a) the picture quality (color and sharpness of focusing) are so great, it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time: -))  b) the lens cover is surely loose, i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times, and au lens tigt and cause potential damage."
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.4019,i wish canon would work out some way for that issue.
0.232,0.619,0.149,-0.1531,"the zooming lever is shaky, i hope it does not operate mechanically, otherwise you'll feel uneasy."
0.0,0.508,0.492,0.7003,great gadget i bought this last week through amazon.
0.0,0.549,0.451,0.6249,got a great deal from a reputable seller.
0.0,0.323,0.677,0.6369,i love this camera.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i am still trying to figure out the may options it has.
0.0,0.631,0.369,0.6249,took hundreds of pictures and they were great.
0.0,0.549,0.451,0.6249,"great colors, pictures and white balance."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for.
0.266,0.667,0.067,-0.6994,"ok for a digital camera maybe it is my lack of experience, but i found shots with this camera very disappointing."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it was (i sold it after a few months) too expensive for the shots that i got.
0.131,0.8,0.069,-0.3506,"sure it had all the features, but when i tried to shoot a girl's basketball game it just wan't up to the task."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i don't think i was asking too much.
0.0,0.759,0.241,0.5423,any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort.
0.0,0.833,0.167,0.4939,and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera.
0.116,0.884,0.0,-0.2732,i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust.
0.253,0.526,0.221,-0.0772,i wanted it to shoot concerts as well.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,that meant even less light and just as much action.
0.215,0.625,0.16,-0.2023,"sure, i adjusted the film speed to 400.  the grain was terrible."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,next time i set it at 100 and used the flash.
0.201,0.671,0.128,-0.2946,"well flash photos are never great, and there was still a lot of noise."
0.0,0.796,0.204,0.6249,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects weren't moving, the photos were awesome."
0.0,0.517,0.483,0.4215,the camera was a marvel.
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.4019,getting the printer to help output them was another tale.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do.
0.231,0.769,0.0,-0.34,"for simple point and shoot photography, consider a cheaper digital."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,you don't need the extra resolution or the cost.
0.0,0.826,0.174,0.2732,then again a one time use camera may do just as well.
0.126,0.733,0.141,0.0772,"if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality, this will be your camera."
0.0,0.704,0.296,0.6369,it is versatile and seems to be one of the best.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"me, i am going with a leica minilux (the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen)."
0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3182,sure.
0.0,0.75,0.25,0.5157,"it is less versatile, but i am never disappointed with the output."
0.056,0.834,0.111,0.3384,"within its limitations i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment, just so you know my bias."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i have been watching the development of digicams for years, waiting to make my first move."
0.0,0.909,0.091,0.1513,"what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses."
0.167,0.833,0.0,-0.296,"i figure that is at least three years off, and i am getting impatient."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations.
0.0,0.802,0.198,0.4522,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality, clean images."
0.077,0.839,0.084,0.0571,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks (even in bright light), and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash."
0.194,0.728,0.078,-0.4791,"as of this writing, technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr."
0.066,0.854,0.08,0.128,"at least once youve got focus lock, the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second, which from what ive read, is better than just about anything else available."
0.173,0.827,0.0,-0.5859,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8.
0.172,0.764,0.064,-0.5267,"once i get focus lock, i can then wait until my restless subject (a pet or a child) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus."
0.351,0.649,0.0,-0.4019,now what about the flash problem?
0.19,0.736,0.074,-0.5859,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr, the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"fortunately, the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash, and fortunately for me, i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy: the metz 60 ct-4."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera, but i can use my metz, with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4."

0.0,0.92,0.08,0.4939,"8. perhaps inspired by the canon's factory white-correction settings (which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out), the g3 has much sharper white offsets."
0.0,0.788,0.212,0.6249,"in english, this means that even straight out of the box, you'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking."

0.0,0.33,0.67,0.7269,i agree with the positive reviews.
0.136,0.864,0.0,-0.395,but there are two things i don't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews.
0.206,0.794,0.0,-0.3804,1) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera.
0.193,0.663,0.145,-0.2023,"i'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap, i may damage the lens."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,very cheaply made.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"2) the body construction - buttons, casing, etc, are too plastic."
0.0,0.455,0.545,0.7184,the g2 was better in this respect.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it had a heavier and more sturdy casing.
0.0,0.706,0.294,0.3612,"despite these grieps, i still recommend the camera."
0.0,0.625,0.375,0.8553,love it more and more i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it!
0.215,0.785,0.0,-0.6697,"there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world, losing a few that i really regretted."
0.057,0.943,0.0,-0.0857,"canon was an obvious choice, but i did not want to limit my decision, so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i researched, held, tested, and observed 3 different brands."
0.0,0.654,0.346,0.5719,"needless to say, the canon won, hands down."

0.0,0.616,0.384,0.6105,"this camera is worth every penny, and i highly recommend it!"
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,another point of note: the battery life is incredible!

0.091,0.909,0.0,-0.2263,forget the fact that it'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera.
0.153,0.847,0.0,-0.3818,"i charged it up the day i got it, took a bunch of pictures and i don't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged."
0.0,0.842,0.158,0.4471,the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging.
0.113,0.722,0.165,0.25,i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures.
0.0,0.76,0.24,0.6249,"the optical zoom is awesome, and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder, but does not detract from the image at all."
0.0,0.884,0.116,0.6369,"as i said, this is the last digital camera i'll buy, and if you are in the market one, my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever."
0.044,0.903,0.053,0.09,"these things may get a lot better in the future, but from what i've seen in the last few years, the technology for digital cameras isn't advancing at the pace of pc's, phones and hard drives."

0.0,0.741,0.259,0.4215,that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw.
0.114,0.653,0.233,0.4404,"to save a picture as raw, you have to have the display on, this seems like a waste of battery power."
0.13,0.87,0.0,-0.4005,it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter?

0.119,0.696,0.186,0.1847,for '' cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and doesn't have any wow factor.
0.0,0.782,0.218,0.6478,it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly.
0.0,0.873,0.127,0.4939,the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography.
0.156,0.708,0.137,-0.1027,"in the hands of someone who doesn't, it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode."
0.058,0.886,0.055,-0.0284,"my wife, who has never used a camera before, picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you don't like what you have created you just delete and try again."
0.0,0.842,0.158,0.4926,the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses!
0.0,0.874,0.126,0.3818,this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3's large mobile screen helps with this.
0.316,0.684,0.0,-0.5719,negative points:  the included memory card is too small.
0.0,0.826,0.174,0.2263,"go out and get a 256meg card, it's worth the expense."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it is made of plastic.
0.0,0.894,0.106,0.3612,"for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped, picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience."
0.163,0.667,0.17,0.0258,"this is by no means unique to this model, i'm sure."
0.0,0.821,0.179,0.5859,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this is not a handbag camera.
0.156,0.844,0.0,-0.2584,"while light, it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile.
0.119,0.881,0.0,-0.3182,"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras, you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost."
0.0,0.802,0.198,0.5719,the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful (and expensive) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography.
0.171,0.829,0.0,-0.5423,the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to.
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4404,"if you can afford this camera, you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble."
0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404,good points:  the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing.
0.0,0.861,0.139,0.4404,canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,learning how to use it will not take very long.
0.0,0.519,0.481,0.5719,the image quality is excellent.
0.0,0.72,0.28,0.765,"messing around with images in photoshop (a supplied software package) and printing them on a good printer, yielded excellent results."
0.0,0.759,0.241,0.4902,"unless you are making posters, a g3 is more than good enough."
0.134,0.794,0.072,-0.1779,range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone: point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography.
0.0,0.839,0.161,0.3182,please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film.
0.122,0.777,0.101,-0.1192,i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first.
0.0,0.811,0.189,0.6369,best camera i've used this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box.
0.102,0.593,0.305,0.7003,the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot.
0.0,0.739,0.261,0.8126,this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,beats that sony f717; its archrival.
0.07,0.728,0.202,0.6111,i'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology;  i can't fit all that resolution (4mp = 2272x 1704 resol.)

0.0,0.813,0.187,0.3182,please go to read dpreview.com and you'll get the complete story.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,my story is based on personal usage.
0.123,0.852,0.025,-0.805,"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion (i don't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i'm going to get) in the viewfinder when you don't zoom (when you zoom the lens distortion goes away), canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture."
0.0,0.844,0.156,0.4497,moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the distortion is not a flaw.
0.112,0.837,0.05,-0.3818,"as with taking digital pictures, i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i've haven't heard about a diagnos or fix for this.
0.0,0.695,0.305,0.6588,"in terms of the shots taken, this camera is insanely great!"
0.0,0.855,0.145,0.5267,the pictures are fabulous and their is a (short) learning curve to it; there are tons of features i haven't even gotten to.
0.0,0.87,0.13,0.2023,"in terms of the important accessories, i got myself an the extra litium battery."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"based on my used, 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots."
0.026,0.974,0.0,-0.1027,i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash (enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash.
0.282,0.682,0.036,-0.8519,the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions (camera and cf) bending (can lead to cf erros) or losing it.
0.0,0.744,0.256,0.4767,"anyways, canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3."
0.0,0.208,0.792,0.5859,it's a winner.
0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4404,"i've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow, car, boat and wind."
0.0,0.813,0.187,0.8062,my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens (the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes) and i'm getting the those (52 mm adapter and uv lens filter) at lensmateonline.com.
0.0,0.704,0.296,0.6369,they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon's.
0.0,0.463,0.537,0.7003,that's what i did and hopes this helps.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,canon g3 review / response / recommendation the camera's a work of art / science -- that's understood.
0.0,0.551,0.449,0.6908,"it takes great pictures, operates quickly, and feels solid."
0.122,0.762,0.115,-0.079,"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews: (1) yes, the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder; however, the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"(2) there are, actually, several differences between the g2 and g3, such as differences in continuous shooting, the optical lens, the control layout, playback zoom, image processing, and so on."
0.0,0.909,0.091,0.1779,"beware you see, i can't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with (j and r camera.)"
0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404,to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product.
0.0,0.918,0.082,0.1779,"although you may think you're dealing with amazon, you're dealing with some second rate store that you've never heard of."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship ""."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit, he said, "" actually we don't ship on saturdays ""."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,so why lie about it?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet.
0.0,0.87,0.13,0.2732,"although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan, they still didn't ship it."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"they said it is in stock, but they are "" too busy ""."
0.0,0.757,0.243,0.4389,"they weren't busy enough to charge the credit card, though!"
0.079,0.86,0.061,-0.128,"although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything, the replies i got were inept as if they hadn't taken time to read the complaint."
0.5,0.5,0.0,-0.25,i cancelled the order.
0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404,hope to get my refund in a timely manner.
0.226,0.298,0.476,0.3968,"thanks for nothing, amazon!"
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,major design flaw this camera has a major design flaw.
0.087,0.913,0.0,-0.2732,when you look through the viewfinder (not the lcd) the bottom left corner of the picture (about 15%) is blocked by the lens.
0.209,0.791,0.0,-0.4404,i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera.
0.0,0.952,0.048,0.1027,"after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder, they finally admitted, it was a design flaw in the camera."
0.0,0.594,0.406,0.6249,everything else about the camera is great.
0.0,0.834,0.166,0.4201,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder, i highly recommend the camera."
0.106,0.894,0.0,-0.3818,"however for me, i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much."
0.184,0.816,0.0,-0.4019,i'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected.
0.0,0.896,0.104,0.6369,"i love it more the longer i own it i've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year, and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom, more adjustability, a hot shoe for an external flash, and a remote control."
0.0,0.89,0.11,0.5563,"i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3, and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics (much more comfortable to hold and use) and the price."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far.
0.0,0.653,0.347,0.4927,"and so far, i've been very pleased."
0.0,0.939,0.061,0.144,"there's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330, especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures."
0.078,0.815,0.107,0.2023,"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light, and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer."
0.0,0.549,0.451,0.6249,the moveable lcd screen is great.
0.129,0.761,0.11,0.0772,"you can take pictures with the camera held above your head, way down, or beside you with no problem, allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself."
0.0,0.866,0.134,0.5719,"the tiny (postage-stamp sized) remote unit is wonderful: not only does it trigger the shutter, it can also be used to zoom and review pictures."
0.0,0.806,0.194,0.7579,"i also purchased a good sturdy tripod: the combination of the new camera, tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor, natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before."
0.036,0.75,0.214,0.9274,"the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit:  i chose the canon speedlite 420.  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs: the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos, red-eye, and annoying shadows; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing, almost-natural lighting."
0.0,0.905,0.095,0.5499,"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330, but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse:  i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery."
0.032,0.968,0.0,-0.1027,"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras: the battery needs to be charged while in the camera, but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery."
0.0,0.832,0.168,0.7227,"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options: shutter priority, aperature priority, light metering adjustments, etc., but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear."
0.0,0.887,0.113,0.5106,"you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting, or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,negatives?
0.11,0.765,0.125,0.079,"i've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330, and the g3 seems to do only slightly better."
0.116,0.884,0.0,-0.3612,(i'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level.)
0.182,0.818,0.0,-0.5994,"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy, and has an awkward, tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera."
0.148,0.852,0.0,-0.5106,"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic, a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i bought a 512 mb card, which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution."
0.216,0.784,0.0,-0.5267,"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly, but there's no difference in working with the files."
0.0,0.873,0.127,0.4939,i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images:  i can imagine that they'd fill up my ibook's internal memory pretty quickly.
0.133,0.867,0.0,-0.4449,"at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe's photoshop elments 2.0 software, and can't praise it highly enough."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"if you're investing in a camera at this level, buy this software!"
0.0,0.877,0.123,0.4215,"and as i said in my review of the s330, all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers."
0.046,0.954,0.0,-0.0772,"the bottom line: if you're serious about your digital photography, or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot, this may be just the camera for you."
0.0,0.877,0.123,0.4497,but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time: you'll see the difference in your photos immediately.
0.0,0.834,0.166,0.4927,added 2-24.  i've now had the camera for two months and i'm even more pleased with it.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting.
0.251,0.615,0.133,-0.3182,"it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures, especially in mixed-light settings."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"if you don't have a gray card, you can use a plain white piece of paper."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting, which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter: the first at the camera-determined exposure, then one lighter and one darker."
0.0,0.653,0.347,0.4927,especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i did buy the telephoto lens (and the required extension).
0.0,0.484,0.516,0.4927,very easy to use.

0.0,0.887,0.113,0.4235,"it can be a point-and-shoot camera, but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it's finer features, i'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice."

0.0,0.777,0.223,0.9217,"the best so far the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it, and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance (picture quality and battery life) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera."
0.0,0.633,0.367,0.7003,canon's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better.
0.0,0.781,0.219,0.6369,"simply, the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point."
0.0,0.916,0.084,0.3182,"the canon allows you to change lenses, and it accepts the ibm microdrive (type ii compact flash), so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage."
0.0,0.94,0.06,0.1027,for me on the fine resolution setting (not maximum but very close) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card.

0.0,0.863,0.137,0.5859,amazing camera i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world.
0.0,0.756,0.244,0.6369,"nikon 4300, i feel, is the best camera out there for the features and price."
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.8988,"here were my requirements in a digital camera:  1. i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while."
0.257,0.743,0.0,-0.6398,2. i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i wasn't comfortable with that.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily.
0.0,0.873,0.127,0.6597,"3. i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although, i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings."
0.0,0.924,0.076,0.2617,"4. and, of course, i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but hadn't used it much."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"depending on all the above requirements, i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models."
0.0,0.906,0.094,0.4404,"nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes, medium; compact size, price, brand name, good software that is included and previous reviews."
0.0,0.715,0.285,0.6115,i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since.
0.0,0.729,0.271,0.624,the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details.
0.075,0.836,0.09,0.1263,a few things that might make it even better:  1. pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance.
0.058,0.942,0.0,-0.228,2. it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow.
0.082,0.918,0.0,-0.1779,3. the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture.
0.33,0.67,0.0,-0.7832,"all the above, i think, are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints."
0.186,0.69,0.124,-0.2263,try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"whichever camera you buy, add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card, usb card reader, camera bag and the warranty."
0.056,0.789,0.155,0.5233,"and finally, get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness."

0.052,0.948,0.0,-0.1779,"the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button, which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models."

0.0,0.841,0.159,0.5256,this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has.
0.0,0.837,0.163,0.4019,it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into.
0.0,0.798,0.202,0.4201,i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots.
0.0,0.581,0.419,0.7574,my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took!
0.35,0.65,0.0,-0.6012,one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus.
0.0,0.855,0.145,0.296,battery life is ok.  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it.
0.208,0.631,0.161,-0.1877,"not disappointed great camera, and for the price you can't beat it."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"we got a 256mb card, and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the only drawbacks that i have noticed:  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long, especially if you use the flash a lot."
0.0,0.834,0.166,0.4902,"so, it's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging."
0.073,0.83,0.097,0.1779,it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light.
0.122,0.708,0.169,0.2936,"i would say that this is not a major issue, but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"it has a 3x optical zoom, which is average for these cameras."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"for more, you sacrifice weight and size: more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length."
0.0,0.909,0.091,0.1027,"it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom, but you sacrifice quality."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason:  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries."
0.064,0.936,0.0,-0.3818,"in manual, you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic; this is not really a hinderance, you just have to be familiar with its menus and features."

0.0,0.678,0.322,0.732,"it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks, so don't think i hate this camera."
0.075,0.693,0.233,0.6077,it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping.

0.0,0.807,0.193,0.8442,"as expected, i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models, and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately."
0.0,0.851,0.149,0.4201,"i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take."
0.0,0.894,0.106,0.4927,the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"try to buy a high capacity ultra card, as it's 2x as faster as the regular cf card."
0.089,0.599,0.312,0.6904,"consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download, it's well worth the little extra money."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy, so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation."
0.0,0.843,0.157,0.3818,use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run.
0.0,0.964,0.036,0.1027,"one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures, one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics, but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb, the math does not add up."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,anybody can explain that?
0.065,0.595,0.341,0.7269,"a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories, as always."
0.0,0.702,0.298,0.8754,you will not be sorry i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet doesn't take weeks to figure out how to operate.
0.0,0.877,0.123,0.5423,we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken.

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300.  i have it for a week now, and this camera has exceeded my expectations."
0.075,0.685,0.24,0.6997,the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away.
0.077,0.865,0.058,-0.296,the shutter lag is on par with what i've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple.
0.136,0.864,0.0,-0.6369,"the only drawbacks i've encountered are: 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color, but i've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i've used even on a nikon slr."

0.0,0.856,0.144,0.3291,2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations.
0.135,0.865,0.0,-0.5574,i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died.
0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404,an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment.
0.188,0.718,0.095,-0.3462,"3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate, but not very robust."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i'll still use my photosuite for editing.
0.116,0.884,0.0,-0.2732,one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing.
0.0,0.935,0.065,0.2023,"just for the heck of it, i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door, and the focusing was just fine."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters.
0.118,0.882,0.0,-0.0516,i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap.
0.227,0.773,0.0,-0.7105,"the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on, the camera won't fit in the small cases, and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find."

0.0,0.71,0.29,0.6735,autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all.

0.0,0.656,0.344,0.6962,the speakerphone:  this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone.
0.0,0.543,0.457,0.6369,as said before this works perfectly.
0.126,0.874,0.0,-0.3818,you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it doesn't make that big of a disturbance.
0.0,0.741,0.259,0.6369,the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly.

0.078,0.922,0.0,-0.296,"only one complaint about the speakerphone, you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone, not while it is ringing."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the radio:  this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in.
0.079,0.684,0.237,0.8042,"this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio, but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone's radio should work perfectly."
0.0,0.909,0.091,0.4927,"tri-band:  one highly beneficial feature of this phone (at least to me) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm, a few in asia."
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.6003,i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly.
0.252,0.748,0.0,-0.4019,the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile.

0.0,0.865,0.135,0.3612,"if it worked like that in south africa, i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe."
0.0,0.826,0.174,0.7096,sold in other parts of the world:  another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world.
0.18,0.607,0.213,0.1911,this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store, which are located in many countries in europe."
0.0,0.781,0.219,0.6522,i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"able to use service in another country:  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time, you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country."
0.0,0.874,0.126,0.1521,you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country.
0.076,0.924,0.0,-0.2263,"size and weight:  when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there; it is unbelievably small and oh, so light."
0.0,0.875,0.125,0.4588,"this is a benefit for many reasons; one being just for appearance, your pants won't be bulging with this phone in your pocket."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,battery life:  the battery life on this phone is surreal.
0.0,0.633,0.367,0.4404,"it lasts, truly, 7 days on standby."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar.
0.0,0.808,0.192,0.5859,it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light.
0.0,0.849,0.151,0.4927,"this phone has many other features, ir,; just to name one, the features above i view as the most beneficial."
0.11,0.89,0.0,-0.6082,"the phone has a few minor inconveniences, but only because it lacks those features, bluetooth and high spend internet, but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do."

0.0,0.709,0.291,0.5719,it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package.
0.0,0.611,0.389,0.4902,so far i am more than pleased.
0.0,0.716,0.284,0.8288,i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go:  pros:  size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you.
0.068,0.613,0.319,0.831,"sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice (check cons) it also doubles as a radio, which is a nice feature when you are bored."
0.0,0.582,0.418,0.7845,speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch.
0.0,0.648,0.352,0.765,"surfing the web on it is nice as well, i just wish there were more wap pages available."
0.203,0.797,0.0,-0.6249,"cons:  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings, there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring."
0.0,0.914,0.086,0.1779,the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out.
0.136,0.864,0.0,-0.4576,games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games.
0.0,0.196,0.804,0.6249,great buy.
0.0,0.651,0.349,0.8807,nice little phone... light compact..  great features..  buttons do seem a little sticky tho.. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem..

0.051,0.742,0.206,0.6542,"perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review, but i actually mean it in earnest."
0.159,0.667,0.174,0.0772,after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply wouldn't perform.
0.0,0.717,0.283,0.5499,"i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling, but definitely more functional device."
0.0,0.882,0.118,0.6124,"although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department, it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do: to be a wireless telephone."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the reception and sound quality are top-notch.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs, which is an unaccustomed luxury, even with t-mobile service."
0.0,0.762,0.238,0.3612,i like the size and weight of this little critter.
0.125,0.875,0.0,-0.3749,"i am able to carry it close to my body, in places where other phones are not so easily concealed."
0.05,0.876,0.074,0.1474,"the keys are close together, and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads, but it's not too weird."
0.083,0.917,0.0,-0.2263,"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing, as many phones use the "" # "" key instead."
0.0,0.652,0.348,0.395,but that's not an insurmoutable obstacle.
0.0,0.538,0.462,0.8225,"the screen is bright, easy to see in the daylight, with nice colors."

0.0,0.967,0.033,0.0772,"the menu options appear one at a time, taking up the whole screen, and one has to scroll down one by one, or have memorized where they are in the menu order, to select them by using the number keypad."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,thumbs down on that one.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the vibrate setting is loud!
0.115,0.699,0.186,0.2755,"so loud, really, that it doesn't work terribly well as a silent ringer option."
0.083,0.841,0.075,0.1531,"but, then again, the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office, when i was already out on the street...  which was a good thing, because i realized i had forgotten my phone...  other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack."
0.102,0.679,0.219,0.8922,"i'd like a camera phone, but i'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls...  pros:  - light, compact design  - solid, high-quality construction  - well-backlit keypad  - outstanding signal reception  - excellent sound quality  - bright, visible screen  - speakerphone  - very long-lasting battery life  cons:  - some features in the user interface  - no voice activated dialing (what were they thinking  - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones."

0.129,0.871,0.0,-0.5106,"the volume key can be hard to press, but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw, perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,pc cable is too expensive... $ 50 for a usb cable?
0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3802,please!
0.0,0.708,0.292,0.5106,is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software?
0.0,0.729,0.271,0.3832,slightly better than average phone in its class.
0.0,0.913,0.087,0.3182,first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year (right after the release contract is over).
0.0,0.8,0.2,0.5423,my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone.
0.0,0.828,0.172,0.6361,below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends:  sound quality:  the most important thing for me is sound quality.
0.146,0.662,0.192,0.1779,nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception.
0.0,0.898,0.102,0.3832,"i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone, the motorolla t720 series, and the sony ericsson t610 series."
0.0,0.849,0.151,0.6249,the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you don't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk.
0.0,0.711,0.289,0.6461,overall design:  i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small.
0.0,0.843,0.157,0.6705,as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a) you wont scratch your screens / keys b) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys.
0.0,0.595,0.405,0.7579,ease of use:  how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu?
0.0,0.564,0.436,0.4754,that is a very nice feature.
0.0,0.823,0.177,0.4215,"the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones (t610, t720i)."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the sony ericsson phone (t610) has the most whistles and bells, but is also the hardest to use."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"battery:  the nokia, samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you don't talk too much."
0.149,0.851,0.0,-0.5423,the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day (although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life).
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,features:  the t610 has the most functionality hands down.
0.0,0.795,0.205,0.4754,personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the t610 can also compose music, a feature which most won't use."
0.256,0.744,0.0,-0.4754,the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless.
0.0,0.898,0.102,0.3832,"it also has a stock tracking app built in (also useless) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics (currency, length, area, etc)."
0.0,0.794,0.206,0.5994,"the s105 (samsung) has a beautiful big display (65,000 colors), and i can't say much about the motorolla."
0.0,0.815,0.185,0.3612,"all these phones have color screens, polymorphic tones, and are internet ready."
0.0,0.842,0.158,0.7876,"in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords (thats number of different instruments which it can play) i think, the samsung i think have 15, i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones."
0.0,0.819,0.181,0.6486,regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop.
0.263,0.508,0.229,-0.1027,i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft.
0.0,0.775,0.225,0.3832,oh well..  overall this is a slightly better than average phone.
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.7964,both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610.  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more.
0.0,0.726,0.274,0.5994,i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610.
0.0,0.962,0.038,0.2846,"they are all free if you get a new account anyway, but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling."
0.0,0.213,0.787,0.5719,perfect phone.

0.0,0.687,0.313,0.8481,"we hardly ever have to charge them, get great reception (live in chicago), and the customization and applications are awesome."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,here's a hint: go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"you can do * so * much more with the pc suite, i.e."
0.0,0.804,0.196,0.765,"free ringtones from midi files, free graphics from any picture on your computer, and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games."
0.036,0.819,0.145,0.6964,"the phone's sound quality is great (turn up the volume if its too quiet, people, this thing will get loud) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing."
0.0,0.594,0.406,0.6249,nokia 6610 great for games and ringtones.

0.0,0.927,0.073,0.4588,the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it.
0.0,0.568,0.432,0.8544,"technology wise, i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great!!!!"

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i waited a few years between phones, mostly because (like most i think) i didnt really need one."
0.0,0.679,0.321,0.7932,"this phone won me over, and a big seller was the size; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out."
0.2,0.8,0.0,-0.25,"the downside though, may be a big one for you."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,its quiet.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,really quiet.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,grandma in church quiet.
0.09,0.91,0.0,-0.4497,"i've gotten used to it (holding it in just the right realation to the ear, ducking into quieter places in bars) but when others borrow it they're shocked i can use it."
0.2,0.714,0.086,-0.6486,"so, i recomend it, but not for those that have any hearing troubles, or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places (which is annoying, by the way.)"
0.0,0.238,0.762,0.4927,incredibly pleased.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"prior to my switch to t-mobile, sprint was my service provider."
0.152,0.848,0.0,-0.5267,"to say the least, i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint, which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"my past two phones were all flip phones, and i was beginning to tire of them."
0.0,0.812,0.188,0.4588,"nokia was my first nonflip phone, and i'm glad i decided to go with them."

0.132,0.74,0.129,-0.274,"nokia 6610 (sound quality) the phone is great with very cool features &amp;#38; options, but comparing to my older motorola phone, it gets a failing grade in speaker quality."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"it's going back today, &amp;#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105."
0.0,0.795,0.205,0.2023,you do take your chances with this phone.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,ultimate phone for mobile life.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i considered this phone (nokia 6610), mainly because of my sister and the features."

0.0,0.463,0.537,0.5399,"truly, i am quite impressed..!!"
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz, with long battery life (not as long as the new polymer technology)."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"on an average, you would charge it once a week."
0.0,0.795,0.205,0.4754,"the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful (like the motorola phone, i used to own)."
0.0,0.417,0.583,0.6369,i simply love this feature.

0.0,0.764,0.236,0.5719,the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport.
0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4939,"if you buy the stereo headset, you will enjoy it much more."
0.0,0.83,0.17,0.6249,the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software (with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth).
0.155,0.845,0.0,-0.296,"no more hazzles of keying in all data, using the small phone keypad."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff.
0.104,0.758,0.137,0.1779,"if you have a good digital camera, there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone."
0.0,0.815,0.185,0.3612,"however, if you are keen, you can attach a camera to this phone."

0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4019,i was immediately interested in the 6610.  i have used this phone for two months now.
0.0,0.815,0.185,0.6124,"not only is it the perfect size (not too small, not too large), it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want."
0.0,0.893,0.107,0.1139,"if you can live without an integrated camera, you won't miss much more."
0.0,0.73,0.27,0.5719,the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent.
0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4404,"even better, with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing, this phone does not have voice dialing."
0.178,0.822,0.0,-0.5023,"the keypad is a decent size, but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press."
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4404,"however, the battery life is good enough you shouldn't be overly concerned with turning this phone off."
0.24,0.76,0.0,-0.6249,in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control.
0.188,0.706,0.106,-0.34,it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia, so standard headphones will not work."
0.0,0.656,0.344,0.6369,overall this is the best phone i have ever owned.
0.214,0.397,0.389,0.296,any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages.

0.0,0.722,0.278,0.4003,one complaint... the screen is too easily scratched!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,but there are faceplates to replace it i guess...  almost there.
0.108,0.892,0.0,-0.235,i got this phone in t-mobile's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal.
0.127,0.873,0.0,-0.386,"i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089, but was waiting for the right phone to come along."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this is almost it but not quite but the price was right.
0.0,0.73,0.27,0.6764,that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce.
0.0,0.598,0.402,0.9337,"it has great battery life, fm radio, excellent signal, hands free speakerphone (which i have to say is probably my favorite function) and downloadable java apps."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"what it lacks for me isn't available on one phone yet, namely gsm850 (also sometimes known as gsm800), bluetooth and edge."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,but for now this will do.
0.062,0.783,0.154,0.5187,"oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone, but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam."

0.0,0.196,0.804,0.6249,great plan.

0.0,0.859,0.141,0.6249,"i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size, speakerphone option, great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email."
0.0,0.93,0.07,0.3612,i went to an at &amp;#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"they told me i would have to connect to my laptop, which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email."
0.0,0.929,0.071,0.0772,"with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10, i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet."

0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404,bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better.
0.226,0.774,0.0,-0.5423,"one more thing, the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible."
0.0,0.448,0.552,0.5719,overall an excellent phone.
0.0,0.687,0.313,0.4927,the service from t-mobile is very good too.

0.108,0.763,0.128,0.1263,i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i've used before.
0.0,0.522,0.478,0.7506,nokia has definitely won me over with this one.
0.0,0.734,0.266,0.6988,best phone out there... a+ not only is this the best phone out there but is cheap (free!!).
0.0,0.868,0.132,0.4404,first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better.
0.0,0.594,0.406,0.6249,the radio feature has superb sound quality.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i've compared this phone to others such as 6100, siemens sl55."
0.153,0.847,0.0,-0.4019,even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it has a classic design yet looks hip.
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4404,is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style.
0.0,0.791,0.209,0.4404,the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,one thing that i found out recently is that you don't need t-zones from tmobile to go online.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data, meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps (with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference)."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net, being able to download pics and ringtones (not java apps, you need t-zones for that)."
0.06,0.797,0.143,0.6144,tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,if you thought about getting this phone buy it.
0.091,0.606,0.303,0.7087,this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities.
0.081,0.699,0.22,0.5574,6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone (s) on demand.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i currrently have service with t-mobile, verizon, and t-mobile."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,that beside you are prob.
0.0,0.925,0.075,0.3989,"very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for, and one that has not yet been mentioned: using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port!"
0.072,0.928,0.0,-0.1027,using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account.
0.0,0.875,0.125,0.2144,"yes it is 56k speed, but the functionality is what you are paying for."
0.0,0.884,0.116,0.7073,i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable (49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com) press dial up on my laptop (by the way it is a mac pb 1gz.
0.0,0.92,0.08,0.1007,"and in a matter of seconds i can access my email, fax, and the entire web from my truck!"
0.096,0.819,0.085,-0.079,the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls (real estate broker software) very well at all.
0.0,0.8,0.2,0.7579,"i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots ""."
0.0,0.792,0.208,0.2732,it does well in all aspects of internet browsing.
0.066,0.659,0.275,0.5859,as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it.
0.0,0.606,0.394,0.2382,sound good but complicated.
0.0,0.752,0.248,0.5106,do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate.
0.1,0.852,0.048,-0.3404,"also, if i want a family plan, which mean i need tw phones on a plan...  so how can i do that... aren't that free for two after the rebates."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,and how can i do that....  print those coupons twice for two phones?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,...
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,don't have the phone just commenting.
0.173,0.827,0.0,-0.3182,i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing.
0.0,0.876,0.124,0.1779,the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon &amp; t-mobile and nokia.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone.
0.0,0.778,0.222,0.5719,my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset.
0.351,0.476,0.173,-0.4576,i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing.
0.437,0.563,0.0,-0.3241,i don't really like bounce.
0.0,0.805,0.195,0.4404,i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones.
0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404,battery life is good for a phone of this size.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"but anyway, the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing."
0.0,0.268,0.732,0.8481,great screen and great sound.
0.0,0.69,0.31,0.5267,"ok, everybody loves the fm radio in this, but you want a cell phone first, right?"
0.0,0.382,0.618,0.7964,"the 6610 excels as a cell phone, thank god."
0.0,0.696,0.304,0.8882,"the voice quality is very good, and it gets great reception (that is, in places where you get t-mobile coverage, which is not that good; see below)."
0.0,0.678,0.322,0.6901,"the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright, and commands are very responsive."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad, which imho is totally unnecessary."
0.0,0.933,0.067,0.3612,"this model does have the traditional key arrangement, it's just that they are really close to one another, and have unconventional shapes, so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands."
0.0,0.909,0.091,0.3182,"(to be fair, the same can be said about many korean imports, and the nokia's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans.)"
0.111,0.704,0.186,0.3612,"other than that, this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"finally, i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier."
0.166,0.834,0.0,-0.5256,"their network coverage is very sporadic, and the network always seems overloaded, resulting in very unpleasant calling experience."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"if you can get this phone for cingular or at&amp;t, go with the other carriers."
0.153,0.278,0.569,0.7906,"great phone, great service, no voice dialing."
0.0,0.745,0.255,0.6249,"the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone, and what a great phone it is."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"when i first saw the 6610, i thought it was too small."
0.0,0.764,0.236,0.5719,"after using it, i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket."
0.0,0.761,0.239,0.8196,"it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder, but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included."
0.0,0.871,0.129,0.3421,"the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all, unless dialing a number."
0.076,0.846,0.078,0.0129,"unfortunately, the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone, but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming."
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4404,"when i turned the phone on, the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is."
0.0,0.633,0.367,0.7495,the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the phone has several color schemes you can choose from.
0.0,0.545,0.455,0.3612,i like the default blue.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,you can also set a background wallpaper.
0.0,0.709,0.291,0.6249,"the ringtones included are awesome, and did i mention they were polyphonic?"
0.565,0.435,0.0,-0.6361,no more annoying series of beeps.
0.0,0.743,0.257,0.5423,this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music.
0.0,0.69,0.31,0.6597,you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call.
0.0,0.954,0.046,0.0772,"the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries, with multiple phone number per entry, so you can program your boss's home, work and cellphone numbers all under one contact."
0.06,0.882,0.058,-0.0258,"the phone also sports an image gallery (with option camera attachment), a calendar / organizer, alarm clock with snooze, fm radio (way cool, even if it is just through an ear-peice), games, java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection."
0.068,0.795,0.136,0.4835,"the gprs connection is sometimes slow, and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain, but the other t-zones applications are quite useful."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"you can get weather, movies, horoscopes and more with a few clicks."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code, but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go."
0.124,0.82,0.056,-0.3958,"one downside: as of this writing, t-mobile hasn't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610.  their website does not show it as a compatible phone, and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported."
0.0,0.737,0.263,0.3612,i have been assured this will be fixed soon.
0.131,0.869,0.0,-0.3412,"now, for the t-mobile service:  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"if you have a question, they have the answer."
0.0,0.789,0.211,0.4939,"and should they not know it, they can find it out pretty quick."
0.0,0.829,0.171,0.5423,every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone.
0.18,0.533,0.287,0.1531,all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved.
0.0,0.741,0.259,0.4199,i'd like to see my old carrier do that!
0.0,0.758,0.242,0.4927,"the rate plans are also very good, at least for me."
0.0,0.872,0.128,0.4748,"different people have different needs, of course, but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked.
0.0,0.705,0.295,0.2716,this phone is highly recommended otherwise.
0.296,0.408,0.296,0.0,t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone.
0.0,0.374,0.626,0.7717,"nokia makes a great phone, that's clear."
0.0,0.711,0.289,0.7579,"with all its complicated features, the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great."
0.176,0.692,0.132,-0.34,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe, etc."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"yet they've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone, including italian, german, and dutch."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile's services, because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network."
0.066,0.934,0.0,-0.296,"therefore, if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card, even if you unlock the phone, there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet."
0.0,0.886,0.114,0.4019,"after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another, i got fed up and have decided to return the phone."
0.08,0.802,0.118,0.2263,"bottom line, if you're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad, forget it."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"find another phone, or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form."
0.0,0.256,0.744,0.4404,a good phone.
0.0,0.658,0.342,0.6369,this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it.
0.0,0.876,0.124,0.3089,i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then..  i didn't had any problem till now.
0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404,the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution.
0.0,0.567,0.433,0.7269,it is very light weight and has a good signal strength.
0.197,0.803,0.0,-0.4019,"however, the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality."
0.167,0.833,0.0,-0.3412,it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier.
0.255,0.745,0.0,-0.3401,when talking the voice is not very clear.
0.0,0.606,0.394,0.5023,"but, i would definately recommend this phone."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,go for it...
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,a quick update to the new zen nx?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"this is an edited review, now that i have had time to use the device."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"while, there are flaws with the machine, the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there.
0.032,0.735,0.233,0.8882,"like it's predecessor, the quickly revised nx, this player boasts a decent size and weight, a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags, and excellent sound (widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business)."
0.0,0.711,0.289,0.6908,"the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger, now-blue backlit screen, which is infinitely better."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"further, the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3."
0.0,0.842,0.158,0.4927,this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short, but only by a bit."
0.16,0.757,0.082,-0.1899,"yes the ipod is smaller, but not $ 200 worth, which is the premium you'll pay for an equivalent capacity model."
0.043,0.848,0.109,0.2502,"yes, the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late, but sure-as-hell isn't worth the $ 200 premium (unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe)."
0.0,0.714,0.286,0.4939,"for me, i'll save that cash for another purchase."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,get this player!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"before i decided to get this player, i did my research."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player."
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.6369,"i chose this one because from what i read, it was the best deal for the money."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,that takes up half the space of mp3's.
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.2023,that's important because i have a lot of music.
0.0,0.423,0.577,0.6249,the software is great.
0.0,0.888,0.112,0.34,"you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories."
0.0,0.4,0.6,0.8402,"transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy."
0.0,0.714,0.286,0.7188,"even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good."
0.62,0.38,0.0,-0.5994,"only 1 problem, no accessories... yet."
0.0,0.815,0.185,0.3387,"i hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard."
0.0,0.738,0.262,0.4927,they player's interface itself is also very easy to use.
0.095,0.678,0.226,0.4404,"can't complain and i recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"get it, it's woth every penny!"
0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,kick a player i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod.
0.0,0.821,0.179,0.357,"i've had it for a week now, don't regret the purchase one bit, and i never leave home without it."
0.179,0.65,0.171,-0.0258,"if you have any doubts about this player, well don't."
0.118,0.718,0.164,0.626,"pros:  software is easy to use (although redhat software is better, but costs money)  much cheaper than i-pod good looking player (beautiful blue back-lit screen) if you've read about the player, some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on, but this is good because the face doesn't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate  no issues as of yet  cons:  you're going to need to buy new headphones, the stock ones suck  hopefully, this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod."
0.0,0.915,0.085,0.0772,"if you want to be a poser and follow the herd, mooooooh, then buy the i-pod."
0.0,0.404,0.596,0.7096,"otherwise, be smart, save the cash."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the sound is the thing!
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.2023,for me the sound of the music is what is important.
0.0,0.497,0.503,0.8442,the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s.
0.054,0.66,0.287,0.7684,navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well.
0.0,0.851,0.149,0.2732,at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the battery is replaceable (a real plus) and there is a leather case (another real plus).
0.0,0.776,0.224,0.7096,i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music.
0.0,0.769,0.231,0.34,so far the software for the pc works easily.
0.0,0.682,0.318,0.4215,"by the way, it looks nice also."
0.365,0.635,0.0,-0.68,an ipod killer: this thing kicks mighty apple butt!
0.152,0.848,0.0,-0.4973,"i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can't, i'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars."
0.0,0.513,0.487,0.2263,it's worth it.
0.091,0.909,0.0,-0.2755,"i personally don't like apple or their business practices (screwing resellers, customers and employees left and right) so i shopped around for something else."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player, i knew i had found what i was looking for."
0.155,0.845,0.0,-0.296,my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price: i found both.
0.0,0.652,0.348,0.6597,this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size, so you have to wonder just how much apple's markup is anyway!"
0.0,0.81,0.19,0.3291,"the sound is excellent, but a tip: get a real pair of headphones."
0.107,0.756,0.137,0.1635,you won't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
0.0,0.887,0.113,0.4199,"the controls are on the side instead of on the front, which i like, because that's where my thumb is when i hold the thing!"
0.0,0.75,0.25,0.4588,the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad.
0.0,0.757,0.243,0.5927,"it could be a little bit bigger, but it's easy to get used to."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the screen may be a little smaller, but it is very readable and doesn't come in the overused blue."
0.0,0.894,0.106,0.2235,"it doesn't have firewire, not a real complaint since most windows users don't generally have firewire cards themselves."
0.087,0.721,0.192,0.4939,"(i would have appreciated having a firewire plug, however)  the included leather pouch is a big plus: it actually protects the unit well, something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"other plusses: changable battery, loads of presets for environments, decent construction, still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,(did i mention you can actually change the battery?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,hello?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,apple?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,are you listening?)
0.0,0.819,0.181,0.6486,i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive (muvo nx) mp3 player models.
0.0,0.909,0.091,0.2755,"since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment, aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make."

0.0,0.79,0.21,0.4927,i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i'm extremely pleased with it.
0.0,0.927,0.073,0.3182,my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time..  just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together.
0.089,0.835,0.076,-0.09,the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go.
0.0,0.734,0.266,0.4404,so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the setup and transfer process was cake for me.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player.
0.0,0.896,0.104,0.438,i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it wasn't a big problem.

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it's been so long since i've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened.
0.538,0.462,0.0,-0.5423,that's probably a bad thing.
0.0,0.794,0.206,0.6652,the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well.
0.138,0.862,0.0,-0.34,"it was always after it finished a process or something, so it didn't cause any file errors."
0.187,0.813,0.0,-0.4576,now that i have all my music on it there hasn't been any more problems.
0.0,0.828,0.172,0.4404,the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it.
0.172,0.828,0.0,-0.4019,i haven't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can't comment on any problems there.
0.0,0.895,0.105,0.4019,the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides.
0.139,0.721,0.139,0.0,the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i don't figure out a way to break it.
0.0,0.58,0.42,0.8271,the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model.
0.0,0.734,0.266,0.6115,all in all though i'm very happy with my new mp3 player.
0.0,0.784,0.216,0.6428,"i'll admit that i'd own an ipod if i had money to burn, but for the money this is a much better buy."

0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404,being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds.
0.199,0.619,0.182,-0.126,when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it's that good!
0.0,0.741,0.259,0.5423,the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior.

0.375,0.625,0.0,-0.6597,dislikes  - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones.
0.165,0.633,0.203,0.1531,the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap &amp; is uncomfortable to use.
0.12,0.655,0.225,0.4091,the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical  - included creative software is pretty poor.
0.0,0.63,0.37,0.8316,red chair's notmad explorer is great &amp; recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software.
0.0,0.525,0.475,0.9787,"note: this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase, but worth it  likes  - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price  - best in class sound  - large easy readable screen"

0.556,0.444,0.0,-0.3612,this is ridiculous.
0.0,0.809,0.191,0.5106,to me this alludes to the manufacturer's confidence that the product will last for a year.

0.524,0.476,0.0,-0.296,difficulties with tags.
0.0,0.816,0.184,0.4019,"if you purchase this product, definitely rip your songs through windows media player."
0.224,0.776,0.0,-0.6372,"otherwise, you'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the (decent) nomad explorer, which is not fun at all."
0.177,0.521,0.302,0.296,this thing seriously is a good player though.
0.0,0.465,0.535,0.3182,another electronics fan.
0.0,0.615,0.385,0.3612,summary  overall i like the unit.
0.113,0.887,0.0,-0.4215,i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance (less than 2 ft).
0.077,0.923,0.0,-0.5423,if it were not for that i would have given it 4.  pros:  1) price / gb of storage  2) storage capacity  3) user replaceable battery  cons:  1) fragile (i broke the 1st one within 10 days)  2) scroll button / switch  3) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing.
0.0,0.833,0.167,0.4215,features that would have been nice:  1) fm receiver - some models out there have this.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,they sell an adapter unit to use with your car's cassette deck.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,but who wants the wires involved.
0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404,a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature.
0.0,0.869,0.131,0.2057,details:  don't drop this unit:  i've had the player for about a month now.
0.0,0.444,0.556,0.3612,overall i like it.
0.219,0.781,0.0,-0.4215,as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days.
0.203,0.797,0.0,-0.4215,i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke.
0.161,0.839,0.0,-0.3612,i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell (murphy strikes again).
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i purchased the extended warranty (something i almost never do) when i returned the unit to get the replacement.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,updating the unit's firmware:  when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website.
0.0,0.818,0.182,0.4404,the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions.
0.096,0.393,0.511,0.891,i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation.
0.0,0.549,0.451,0.6249,storage:  the storage capacity is great.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i don't think i will ever use the full 30gb.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i haven't even used 10gb of storage yet.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i'm starting to listen to cd's that i haven't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding, you can encode your cd's at varying quality levels."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
0.0,0.802,0.198,0.4939,the higher the number the better the quality (less data compression is used) and the larger the file size.
0.0,0.884,0.116,0.3612,if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps.
0.0,0.89,0.11,0.1531,you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player.
0.072,0.885,0.043,-0.2263,"if you're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end (typically 128 is considered close to cd quality)."
0.0,0.661,0.339,0.6249,price:  the price compared to the ipod is great.
0.061,0.877,0.061,0.0,"price, along with the replaceable battery (which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3's in the mp3 format.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it using something called ac3 (at least the trial song i purchased was in this format) which is not a compatible format for the nomad.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i haven't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes.
0.303,0.697,0.0,-0.5824,but for now it appears that this player doesn't play well with itunes.
0.292,0.708,0.0,-0.5106,scroll bar:  the scroll bar is a bit of a pain.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items.
0.0,0.512,0.488,0.8885,"it's not the end of the world, but a better design sure would be nice."
0.45,0.55,0.0,-0.5994,software:  i've had no problems with the software.
0.0,0.856,0.144,0.4939,i found it intuitive to use (i didn't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes).
0.052,0.821,0.127,0.25,the software will convert your cd's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to.
0.0,0.862,0.138,0.4939,my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly (i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd).
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,through the software you can classify songs in genres.
0.0,0.588,0.412,0.4215,this is a nice feature (i.e.
0.215,0.658,0.127,-0.25,"it's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the software comes with plenty of defaults genres.
0.148,0.704,0.148,-0.0026,you can also create your own if you don't like their classifications.
0.0,0.882,0.118,0.34,you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass.
0.0,0.72,0.28,0.6808,"in addition, you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player."
0.0,0.267,0.733,0.6705,this is pretty cool.
0.257,0.628,0.115,-0.4033,sound:  the sound from the player is ok.  i was a little disappointed in the low end.
0.0,0.795,0.205,0.2023,i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended.
0.0,0.71,0.29,0.6486,i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected.
0.0,0.819,0.181,0.6486,"it's probably good for the health of your ears, however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range (and my hearing is fine)."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,searching for dennis!
0.0,0.16,0.84,0.8883,"wow, dennis sure is great!"
0.0,0.854,0.146,0.4404,"slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review, similar to when i look in the mirror."
0.05,0.731,0.219,0.7269,"this thing is great, i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records."
0.181,0.67,0.149,0.1021,"sometimes when i get really lonely, i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles, and while this doesn't help, i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too, nah mean!?"
0.039,0.722,0.239,0.886,"i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on, but creative did a good job with this, as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,there was very little light in there.
0.0,0.747,0.253,0.5242,"anyway, im gon na go find dennis now, have a nice day!!"
0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,!
0.0,0.855,0.145,0.296,"it is ok, but... i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it was not my first choice.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra.
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4404,"one good thing, it is 40 gb of disk space (well, it is 38 gb in reality)."
0.0,0.715,0.285,0.4927,for the price and features it is really good.
0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404,"one thing, before buying this player i have called the creative tech."
0.0,0.722,0.278,0.6597,support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes.
0.204,0.37,0.426,0.34,sure enough there is no such ability.
0.067,0.849,0.085,0.1376,"not sure, if customer rep. did not know the product exactly, it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear."
0.08,0.697,0.224,0.4404,"in any case, navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders."
0.091,0.909,0.0,-0.296,"you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre, no other division."
0.0,0.799,0.201,0.8074,"creative is talking about updating it via firmware, however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players, looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates, not too much of new features."
0.194,0.806,0.0,-0.3412,"the software, which comes with player is not good at all."
0.0,0.756,0.244,0.4404,i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad.
0.0,0.865,0.135,0.3612,notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product.
0.0,0.604,0.396,0.8957,"transfer files is easy using notmad, however again, would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver, rca lyra and some other."
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4404,often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables.
0.0,0.828,0.172,0.6369,"artist, album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player, and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory."
0.08,0.739,0.181,0.4201,"after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive, so better organization is required."
0.0,0.903,0.097,0.4215,"the bottom line, i'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver."
0.0,0.67,0.33,0.8126,"the bundled software blows, yes...... but i heard of notmad explorer (http://redchairsoftware.com) from the creative tech support people."
0.0,0.818,0.182,0.4588,"i downloaded the trial version, and after less than 10 minutes of using it, decided it was well worth the price."
0.265,0.478,0.256,-0.0534,"so yes, as with all software bundled with creative products, it was useless and ugly."
0.0,0.522,0.478,0.7506,"for once, though, this 3rd party software is excellent."
0.0,0.778,0.222,0.431,dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,zens rule.
0.197,0.455,0.348,0.25,unmatched quality and beyond cool.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,originally i wanted the ipod.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist.
0.0,0.917,0.083,0.4019,"i like the way apple is innovative, but let's face it - they can't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long, especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks, spills my beer, but doesn't wash my car."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,so what?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i can do that myself.
0.0,0.848,0.152,0.3612,"longer battery life, greater accessibility to online music services, and pc compatibility are the sensibilities."
0.167,0.833,0.0,-0.296,"the visceral teases include the case, the sound quality, and the capacity."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i haven't checked the resilience of my xtra yet, and don't plan to."
0.167,0.641,0.192,-0.1027,"however, if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen, please share your experiences."
0.308,0.692,0.0,-0.5994,i'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields.
0.234,0.467,0.299,0.1779,it can get pretty lonely out there.
0.0,0.256,0.744,0.4404,creative thinking.
0.0,0.704,0.296,0.6369,i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it.
0.0,0.637,0.363,0.9413,"the sound is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent, and finally the price, $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod, is excellent."
0.0,0.865,0.135,0.3612,"the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style, size, and ease of use."
0.0,0.786,0.214,0.7002,"the nomad is not ugly, it is not that big, it comfortably fits in my pocket, or heavy, and the controls are not hard to get used to."
0.187,0.742,0.071,-0.4703,"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance, also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i only have one question, when i add tracks to my nomad, via nomad explorer, they are automatically put in alphebetical order, rather than album order."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"is this possible to fix, if so how, if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this?"
0.0,0.815,0.185,0.3612,i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering.
0.0,0.782,0.218,0.4199,"thank you very much, and go out and get yourself a nomad!"
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,got to get an ipod!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,wow...  this thing is trash.
0.0,0.822,0.178,0.0772,want the laundry list of reasons why?
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,of course you do!
0.108,0.762,0.13,0.5391,"a) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily, and it definately wouldnt survive a drop  b) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display  c) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said  d) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate, crashes frequently, screwed my music library up, doesnt work with mp4s, the list goes on and on  e) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage  f) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash, you want something that has the asthetics bit down, of course  so...  im taking mine back tomorrow morning, and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead."
0.0,0.879,0.121,0.3252,"don't waste your time, engery, resources on this thing, just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,don't buy it.
0.0,0.674,0.326,0.4404,i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift.
0.767,0.233,0.0,-0.5106,what a disappointment.
0.524,0.476,0.0,-0.5106,the software failed repeatedly.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i couldn't load more than one song before the software crashed.
0.226,0.323,0.452,0.4215,creative labs customer support website is useless.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,software downloads on the site crashed my pc.
0.0,0.763,0.237,0.6808,creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,don't buy this thing.
0.0,0.328,0.672,0.6249,great mp3 player.
0.0,0.656,0.344,0.6369,i just bought this player today and i already love it.
0.095,0.789,0.116,0.119,it has a few inconveniences: one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd.
0.078,0.922,0.0,-0.296,"another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long, it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on."
0.0,0.477,0.523,0.6588,"otherwise, this player is awesome!"
0.0,0.722,0.278,0.6124,it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily.
0.0,0.671,0.329,0.6597,"the volume range is great, so you can blast it if you want."
0.0,0.515,0.485,0.765,"overall, this player is awesome and i definately recommend it."
0.0,0.213,0.787,0.5719,perfect purchase.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing (i recomend www.nomadness.net), and price-wise zens are unbeatable."
0.0,0.678,0.322,0.6908,"compared to other leading hdd mp3 players, the value per gb is the tops."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0, - price: see above.
0.0,0.709,0.291,0.5719," - sound quality: excellent, everything you would expect from this company."
0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404, - the unit is easy to use and intuitive.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls.
0.0,0.633,0.367,0.4404, - uploading music is quick and easy.
0.147,0.652,0.201,0.25,"although the supplied software can be annoying at times, on whole it is excellent."
0.229,0.771,0.0,-0.3976,"i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,(it's fast too!)
0.0,0.591,0.409,0.8402,"btw, be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly, as this will ensure a great organization."
0.0,0.877,0.123,0.2732,"- the unit itself its well structured, with just the buttons you need and none you don't."
0.188,0.699,0.113,-0.3378,"as often mentioned, the scroll tab is average, however, not difficult to use or horrible."
0.0,0.806,0.194,0.34,"structurally, everything is secure and it won't fall apart on you."
0.0,0.729,0.271,0.6369,"the screen is large, defined, and easy to read, and the silver unit is naturally cool."
0.0,0.803,0.197,0.4019,"there are lots of interesting features included such as eax, and customization."
0.0,0.772,0.228,0.7579," - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out (as all lithium batteries do), you will be able to buy another easily."
0.113,0.887,0.0,-0.1027,ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"also, the nomad's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"- equipment included is average, but that isn't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for."
0.191,0.677,0.132,-0.2382,"the case is strong and stylish, but unfortunately lacks a window (now a big deal)."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the headphone earbuds are average, so just use your regular pair instead."
0.0,0.638,0.362,0.5267,conclusion:  this player is an ideal purchase.
0.0,0.86,0.14,0.5023,"there isn't need to get in details again, but just remember it rocks because: price, sound, ease of use, and features."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i would recogmend this player to anyone i know, and you will not be dissapointed."
0.0,0.476,0.524,0.5106,impressive with few flaws.
0.212,0.691,0.097,-0.5429,the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt.
0.257,0.576,0.167,-0.1796,i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,on my main computer the software did not work right.
0.108,0.763,0.129,0.1134,i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all.
0.165,0.671,0.165,0.0,i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself.
0.0,0.649,0.351,0.6597,i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work, because it works on all the other computers i have."
0.131,0.777,0.092,-0.2023,so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost.
0.0,0.0,1.0,0.6249,awesome.
0.0,0.738,0.262,0.4927,i'm very pleased with my zx so here's a quick review.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,first there's the unit itself.
0.0,0.907,0.093,0.438,"it is small overall, bigger than the ipod, but keep in mind that this is because different, less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx."
0.0,0.844,0.156,0.5423,"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod, however it compromises a bit of the unit's size in doing so."
0.0,0.796,0.204,0.7501,"the lcd is larger than the previous model, the nx, and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx's green backlight did."
0.157,0.633,0.211,0.4215,"the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me, however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate."
0.131,0.476,0.393,0.6597,the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product.
0.0,0.828,0.172,0.6808,"the included eax support is useful at times, especially when you listen to a variety of genres, as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle."
0.169,0.831,0.0,-0.7109,"the environmental audio, however, is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it (i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates.)"
0.0,0.89,0.11,0.6908,"the signal to noise ratio (the ratio of detectable, useful data to unusable garbage in, say, a radio wave; a larger stn ratio is better) is nice and high at 98 decibles, and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the software hasn't been a hassle for me at all.
0.113,0.887,0.0,-0.3182,i ignored the instruction booklet (as i do with any product) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes.
0.0,0.9,0.1,0.2732,"my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well, and she is of average computer competence."
0.0,0.885,0.115,0.4588,"the less computer-saavy might find apple's software a bit friendlier, though (i use it at a friend's house and it does do a lot more for you.)"
0.0,0.865,0.135,0.5574,"lastly, the price is fantastic:  i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx, compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120."
0.158,0.766,0.077,-0.6705,"for prospective buyers, i would warn of the following: 1) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible, as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable (this applies to earbuds in general,) and 2) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them, that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves."
0.0,0.873,0.127,0.6908,"if you want great sound quality, don't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte, don't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users, and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount, then i would suggest the zen xtra for you."
0.0,0.141,0.859,0.7269,it's pretty good.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it!!
0.253,0.747,0.0,-0.9038,(i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead).
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need.
0.135,0.801,0.064,-0.3818,eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs (reviewers figures)  i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds.
0.13,0.449,0.421,0.7043,"usb 2.0 - very fast  yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap, replace them."
0.0,0.652,0.348,0.7869,but the sound is very good (and loud) and works well on my portable speakers.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world (and is quite small).
0.0,0.822,0.178,0.3804,"it looks very cool, and seems quite small to me and very light."
0.348,0.496,0.156,-0.4019,"the scroll button seems ok, i have no problems with it."
0.0,0.556,0.444,0.4927,i am very pleased so far.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i had all my files already on my pc in wma format (200 cd's).
0.495,0.25,0.255,-0.4309,"so far so good, no problems, no conversions."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,very simple to use.
0.0,0.76,0.24,0.6249,the reason it does not get 5 stars  1) a spare battery would have been great.
0.163,0.667,0.17,0.0258,2) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it.
0.184,0.721,0.095,-0.1828,"3) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer, like some players  all in all suprisingly easy to use."
0.0,0.494,0.506,0.6249,a great player for the price.
0.0,0.796,0.204,0.5927,"summary:  lots of flaws, but exceptional sound quality, hd size, and price make it a good buy."
0.0,0.581,0.419,0.7579,pros:  excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox.
0.12,0.656,0.224,0.4404,"there was no distortion and it sounded great, especially with eax environmental audio enabled."
0.162,0.838,0.0,-0.5267,"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk, so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad."
0.0,0.859,0.141,0.4215,i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software.
0.109,0.698,0.194,0.2732,"however, it doesn't register instantly as a hard drive like other players."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"you have to install the software to the computer you're transferring to, instead of just connecting it with a usb connection."
0.0,0.641,0.359,0.4215,this would have been much easier.
0.069,0.931,0.0,-0.1027,"the nomad can hold any type of file, not just mp3, so you can use it as a portable hard disk."
0.0,0.758,0.242,0.4927,i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer.
0.208,0.623,0.17,-0.0935,this almost made it worth the price alone.
0.0,0.798,0.202,0.5106,"i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer, and then transfer them to a friend's."
0.0,0.859,0.141,0.3182,"huge storage space - even at 320kbs, you can store a ton of songs on this thing."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,30gb is more than enough for most people.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,cons:  navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs.
0.0,0.854,0.146,0.6249,"this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags, and if you've downloaded your songs off the internet, many probably don't."
0.0,0.811,0.189,0.4215,it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system.
0.0,0.862,0.138,0.34,you can't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it.
0.105,0.895,0.0,-0.4019,"whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox, it dumps all of them into a single folder, and then sorts them by the id3 tags."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,fm receiver - it has none.
0.0,0.823,0.177,0.4215,i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether.
0.072,0.928,0.0,-0.1027,cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners.
0.101,0.792,0.107,0.024,"the player feels very delicate, as if i'm holding an actual hard drive."
0.179,0.821,0.0,-0.2411,i'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"as a portable player, it should feel a bit more durable."
0.0,0.899,0.101,0.2023,the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable.
0.127,0.873,0.0,-0.1531,i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this is not a player you can take jogging.
0.162,0.638,0.199,0.119,the songs don't play one after another like on a cd.
0.0,0.816,0.184,0.2023,you have to add them to the playing list.
0.0,0.854,0.146,0.34,"i can't simply bring up my entire list of songs, click play, and then hit next."
0.0,0.789,0.211,0.34,you have to add all the songs to a play list.
0.0,0.823,0.177,0.4215,"there is probably an easier way to do this, i just haven't found it yet."
0.394,0.606,0.0,-0.3818,software - the software is crap.
0.0,0.621,0.379,0.7269,"i use it for ripping cds, which it does a pretty good job of."
0.369,0.631,0.0,-0.4767,"otherwise, it is difficult to figure out and awkward."
0.18,0.668,0.152,0.1352,"like most people, i don't want to read the instructions, i just want to use it."
0.104,0.896,0.0,-0.1027,"even after reading some of the instructions, it's still hard to figure out."
0.0,0.894,0.106,0.3612,"i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer, "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet."
0.216,0.784,0.0,-0.296,"no line out jack - as i said, there is none."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack.
0.0,0.866,0.134,0.5719,"so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter, but you don't get the quality from a true line out jack."
0.0,0.844,0.156,0.5719,"it sounds decent, but i would estimate you get maybe 80% of the quality that you would from a true line out jack."
0.348,0.652,0.0,-0.1531,controls are a bit awkward.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the controls definately took some getting used to.
0.138,0.862,0.0,-0.3412,it wasn't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was.
0.0,0.851,0.149,0.4215,a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included.
0.0,0.951,0.049,0.0772,"i want to have instant access to the volume, not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it."
0.783,0.217,0.0,-0.5574,crappy headphones.
0.394,0.606,0.0,-0.3818,the included earbuds were uncomfortable.
0.0,0.581,0.419,0.7574,i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones.
0.41,0.59,0.0,-0.7133,"difficult navigation - i won't necessarily say "" difficult, "" but i don't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate."
0.0,0.902,0.098,0.0772,"it is a bit cumbersome, and i can't get to the songs i want as quickly."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i think this is it's biggest flaw.
0.0,0.815,0.185,0.3612,i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes.
0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404,"up, down, left, and right would have given me better control."
0.044,0.915,0.041,-0.0289,"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long (which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through), it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and won't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case.
0.0,0.896,0.104,0.4404,"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen, and if the button didn't cover up the ac jack."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,that way i could keep it in the case all the time.
0.093,0.8,0.107,0.1027,"as it stands now, the case is pretty useless unless you're packing the player up for travel, or if you load up all your songs beforehand."
0.123,0.877,0.0,-0.2732,you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though.
0.0,0.748,0.252,0.5719,"overall, i feel that it's a decent buy, and am happy that i own it."
0.153,0.639,0.208,0.4019,"i am willing to overlook it's problems to get superior sound quality and low price, although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement."
0.335,0.502,0.163,-0.4678,"good for the money, but software is awful."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"after looking over multiple large mp3 players, i decided to get this one."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"for the price and size and features, you can't beat the price."
0.041,0.959,0.0,-0.1027,"a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins, accesses files or does antyhing."
0.0,0.922,0.078,0.2382,"i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection, whihc is a plus, but then again it is only speculation."
0.0,0.715,0.285,0.4927,the buttons and interface are very easy to use.
0.0,0.824,0.176,0.4927,"simple click buttons, back buttons volume and display are very easy to read, access and use."
0.307,0.693,0.0,-0.5499,but the major problem i had was with the software.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"you are not able to simply import files, but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the instructions that come with it don't explain how to make things simple.
0.228,0.772,0.0,-0.616,the quick sync isn't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just isn't very useful.
0.166,0.834,0.0,-0.3804,i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused.
0.08,0.92,0.0,-0.1027,i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player.
0.0,0.704,0.296,0.2732,well that was not a simple task.
0.11,0.89,0.0,-0.2732,i ended up suing windows player to make mp3's (actually wma files) and then using the probram to transfer.
0.149,0.851,0.0,-0.5511,"i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer, becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate."
0.136,0.864,0.0,-0.296,"buy this for the storage and price, avoid it if you know nothing about computers."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,buy this instead of an ipod.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper.
0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404,"the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface ""."
0.0,0.856,0.144,0.4927,i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,also the ipod has games on it.
0.0,0.862,0.138,0.1531,"games are ok for a cell phone, but mp3's are for music."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this thing roxxorz.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i purchased this player last week.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on.
0.136,0.864,0.0,-0.296,i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway.
0.45,0.55,0.0,-0.5994,i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product.
0.0,0.731,0.269,0.4692,the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine.
0.094,0.906,0.0,-0.2924,"the headphones aren't the best, but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity."
0.17,0.72,0.11,-0.1531,"the battery life seems good, takes very lttle time to charge, it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs."
0.0,0.772,0.228,0.6925,"took me a few tries to get use to the navigation, but it's a very user friendly player imo."
0.0,0.736,0.264,0.6943,"i haven't messed with the firmware at all, the player worked perfect for me right out of the box."
0.0,0.431,0.569,0.765,"all-in-all, this is another excellent creative product."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"if you have the money and need 40 gb, this is the player for you."
0.0,0.692,0.308,0.5994,"it's small, light and nice looking and the display is decent as well."
0.0,0.667,0.333,0.3612,i would recommend this product to anyone.
0.286,0.714,0.0,-0.3412,it doesn't get any better than this.
0.078,0.723,0.199,0.7708,"before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one, and now that i have it i couldn't be happier and i'm convinced it's the best one out there."
0.0,0.907,0.093,0.3089,"many people have written about the software being its one downfall, personally i haven't had a single problem with the software, i'm running windows me."
0.041,0.849,0.11,0.5173,"the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy, and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player, so it won't take up space on your pc hard drive."

0.184,0.816,0.0,-0.3566,"the controls on the player are very simple, no need for a manual."
0.0,0.703,0.297,0.886,"the player is fast and sounds great, it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music, or making it sound like you're hearing the music in a huge auditorium."
0.0,0.951,0.049,0.136,"the battery lasts very long when playing music, but writing files to the player drains the battery fast, so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"i purchased and returned this product, but not because of any glaring flaws in the design."
0.143,0.714,0.143,0.0,i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i quickly discovered that the nomad wasn't going to work for me.
0.0,0.797,0.203,0.4215,the reasons below will be true for any product in this category.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,here's why:  1. i don't need the nomad at the office.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i have my mp3's stored on my workstation.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2. i don't need the nomad at home for the same reason (although using it to sync between the two pc's might be a reason enough to get it.)
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3. it's a hazard in the car.
0.106,0.835,0.059,-0.3699,"the navigation is nice enough, but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks, hundreds of albums or artists, or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,) 3a.
0.118,0.637,0.245,0.3806,creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 wasn't as easy as i would have liked.
0.129,0.871,0.0,-0.5106,"the bottom line:  if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions, i'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk."
0.0,0.663,0.337,0.8641,"sure it's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around, but it will be easier to manage and i'll save around 250 bucks."
0.333,0.53,0.136,-0.3818,one major complaint:  my only significant complaint is sound quality.
0.101,0.899,0.0,-0.2263,the eax sound enhancement feature didn't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this did not give me enough control.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter.
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4019,"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost."
0.048,0.785,0.168,0.9994,"  the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad.

263_3	2.95	it is an extremely cool gizmo.

264_1	2.25	great product.

264_2	0.05	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players.

264_3	0	so then i came across the ipod (10 gb).

264_4	0.6	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one.

264_5	0.2	well i decided to get this one.

264_6	1.8	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket.

264_7	1.95	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player (at that size and the price).

264_8	-0.55	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it, it will be a breeze.

264_9	1.15	enjoy.

265_1	3.25	in a word... amazing i got this for christmas.

265_2	1.2	i was going to get a 10gb ipod, but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com (battery lasts 18 months;  it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99...  what a big improvement... lol) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers, i realized this is a much better buy.

265_3	1.75	not only is it more affordable, but its a better player for windows, which is what i have.

265_4	0	anyway, on with the review.

265_5	0.05	so far i've only had it since christmas, so i cant tell you much about the battery life.

265_6	1.25	it hasnt gone below the second notch (i charge mine whenever i'm at home and not using it), so the battery life seems fine (so far).

265_7	-0.25	software: for the people who complain about software, please, stop complaining.

265_8	1.45	once you hook the thing up to the computer (via the usb cable), the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it's there &amp; installs the drivers.

265_9	0.25	from there, you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player (with the help of the media sniffer... read the manual).

265_10	-1	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags &amp; that takes a while to do if your mp3 files don't have them.

265_11	1	if you're copying cds with windows media, its really simple to give your songs id3 tags, so thats what i do.

265_12	1.95	oh... and file transfers are fast &amp; easy.

265_13	0.05	the player: it's silver.

265_14	0.45	a little weighty (9 ounces... no biggie), but otherwise fine.

265_15	-0.45	people complain about the scroll wheel, but its not a big deal at all (though it is just a little annoying at times).

265_16	1.35	it's easy.

265_17	1.85	the buttons are easy to use, and its easy to navigate.

265_18	1.8	the big backlight makes things easy to see, and the writing is big enough for people to see.

265_19	1.7	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature.

265_20	0.75	you can customize bass, etc.

265_21	0.7	like usual, but also you can customize the sound of the player (like how it would sound in a concert hall, jazz club, etc).

265_22	2.15	its really cool.

265_23	3	sound quality is amazing.

265_24	1.8	i was expecting worse, but its really good (especially if your files have good sound quality).

265_25	1.8	you can also slow a song down &amp; speed it up, which is cool too.

265_26	-2.45	but the earbuds suck!

265_27	0.75	buy new ones asap.

265_28	-0.75	every time you move your face or something they pop out.

265_29	-0.9	for a 250 dollar player, they could have thrown in nice headphones.

265_30	-0.35	a remote would have been cool too... but lets not push it.

265_31	0	oh... one more thing.

265_32	-1.3	i forgot, the case doesn't fit.

265_33	-1.65	my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty, but the case isnt that great.

265_34	-0.7	so far the player froze on me once (i started pushing buttons before it loaded) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that.

265_35	1.25	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button &amp; you're golden.

265_36	1.4	also, you can store data on it, which is a plus.

265_37	1.95	for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod, don't bother, this is a much better buy.

265_38	0.65	hope i helped!

266_1	-1.65	simply doesnt shine.

266_2	0.25	i'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder...  what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox...  based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible (which by hardware standards... they were)...  but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software, the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo...  now we come to the zen xtra...  first i'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good...  the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad (but still rather larger than i had expected)...  what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software.

266_3	-2.65	not just the transfer software (which was a hellishly horrible experience) but also the player's software.

266_4	-2.75	first of all, many actions that the player utilizes don't make sense..  bookmarks for example, are an excellent feature... but not on this player...  rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area, the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made..  this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks...  the dynamic playlists ( now playing "", i belive creative calls it) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate...  well, anyway i could go on and on on why this player didn't meet my expectations...  i'll just say this...  for the average music listener not expecting much... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player...  but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback... i can't recommend this product."

0.078,0.922,0.0,-0.3182,"while the listing process is accurate for track names (unlike windows ' reliance on the amg, which frequently gets track listings out of order), the results can be odd."

0.241,0.759,0.0,-0.721,a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"again, you can change this, but it's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you don't have the title of the other disk in front of you."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk, it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second."

0.071,0.773,0.157,0.4588,this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues.
0.0,0.884,0.116,0.4404,zen good points:  1. i achieved my basic objective; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more.
0.091,0.909,0.0,-0.4019,2. most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next; it's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous.
0.044,0.898,0.058,0.1779,the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i don't even notice the click.
0.0,0.924,0.076,0.3716,"flaws:  1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip, catalog &amp; burn music if you are starting from scratch; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen (278 cds; 3,400 tracks; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps) and guess what?"

0.0,0.912,0.088,0.4404,"btw, if you * are * ripping your cds, mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct &amp; uncluttered ] tag information."

0.0,0.824,0.176,0.5994,"some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files;  i didn't use it long enough to know, but clearly you need to use it with caution."
0.135,0.822,0.042,-0.4306,"4.the zen * stores * data files, but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk (they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched)."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"in other words, the zen is not a convenient data storage device; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection (see point 1. for some sizing information)."

0.0,0.917,0.083,0.1139,but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version.
0.176,0.758,0.066,-0.5423,to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews (with many complaints about the lack of stop button) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out &amp; document it.
0.0,0.943,0.057,0.1877,"6. the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge; it does not charge by usb cable; this is not tragic, but usb recharging would be a convenient (additional) choice."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7. mediasource did not install on my personal notebook.
0.185,0.815,0.0,-0.7391,"it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem;  i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error."

0.131,0.563,0.306,0.7783,third party software to the rescue  after much frustration (above) i found the notmad explorer; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer &amp; organization problems.
0.0,0.72,0.28,0.8126,"i am not associated with the company, i am not providing a url, but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily."
0.088,0.883,0.029,-0.4019,this provides drag &amp; drop transfers of music between the computer &amp; zen; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen (.
0.146,0.762,0.093,-0.5603,"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp, but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists); it doesn't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray!"
0.067,0.846,0.087,0.2232,"notmad has other features too, but this is not an advertisement so please see the company's web site for more information...  conclusion:  if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod &amp; avoided the zen."
0.0,0.829,0.171,0.5719,given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software.

0.0,0.861,0.139,0.4404,my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things.

0.414,0.36,0.225,-0.4767,"like other reviewers, installation was hell."

0.121,0.81,0.069,-0.2764,"my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be, at best, a 40gb portable hard drive, albeit one on which i can't create folders, or, at worst, a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again (i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating)."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,my gut tells me i'll also end up buying an ipod.

0.0,0.714,0.286,0.6369,the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers (1 song / sec!).
0.0,0.757,0.243,0.7269,"5) the cheap, user-replaceable battery ($ 50 from creative) is a great advantage over the ipod's battery which costs $ 100 to replace."
0.0,0.654,0.346,0.5719,6) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod's.
0.0,0.737,0.263,0.6124,7) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate.
0.0,0.851,0.149,0.6486,i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk (by accident) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather (by design) and it has continued to work fine.
0.0,0.64,0.36,0.8957,"8) creative mediasource, although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer, is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service (gracenotes)."

0.048,0.952,0.0,-0.2584,cons:  1) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"2) music organization is based on id3 (by genre, artist, album, etc."
0.259,0.741,0.0,-0.5994,) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information.
0.0,0.917,0.083,0.3089,this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music.

0.051,0.785,0.165,0.6706,this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files (through mediasource) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files.
0.147,0.667,0.187,0.1531,4) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras.
0.134,0.698,0.169,0.1531,5) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative's marketing.
0.0,0.611,0.389,0.7906,"both creative and third-party powered speakers work great, as do third-party wireless transmitters."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary.

0.068,0.932,0.0,-0.4019,7) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch.
0.0,0.879,0.121,0.4404,experience:  once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it (which i could do with my flash player).
0.0,0.944,0.056,0.2382,i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen.

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,recommendations:  1) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive.

0.0,0.876,0.124,0.3089,3) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year.
0.0,0.871,0.129,0.5106,"4) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player's usability (the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio, home receiver, etc.)"

296_2	0.05	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod, creative zen, rio karma and iriver ihp - you'll notice that each has their pros and cons; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later.

296_3	-1.55	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed, fault proof, good product support, easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and don't buy yet.

296_4	-0.95	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while.

296_5	-0.15	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now, but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you.

296_6	0.8	ipod clearly has the most buzz.

296_7	2.35	great design and looks cool.

296_9	-1.55	it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents; however, enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can't be used.

296_10	-1.55	some of the more geeky (non-apple type) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface.

296_11	0.65	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery, yet this is the price of sturdy construction.

296_12	1.2	ipod can be used as an external disk, and apparently stores files without problem.

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,pro: 1.  removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years.
0.168,0.678,0.155,-0.0681,my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up.

0.0,0.714,0.286,0.34,2.  value: comparing data storage with price.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.  size and style:  the appearance is okayed (at least not ugly).
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the size is small (just a little bit bigger than an i-pod.)
0.0,0.868,0.132,0.4404,"4.  easy to use: a lot of reviews has mentioned about this  con:  the software, mediasource, cannot work on my pc."

0.0,0.68,0.32,0.7684,"6.  i dont know what other people are saying, but the software is awesome."
0.0,0.764,0.236,0.7877,"you can easily access ur files, and easily fill in the id3 tags, which can take a while with a big collection of music, but if your not lazy, you will do it without a problem."
0.0,0.864,0.136,0.3657,"and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3, so its not a problem."
0.0,0.663,0.337,0.765,"7.  battery recharge, is an awesome thing, because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours."
0.0,0.921,0.079,0.34,"8.  when you turn on your player, the player turns on really fast, and the music continues to play, as you left it when you were turning it off."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"9.  you can manage your profile, change the contrast of backlight, make different type of display, either list or tabbed."
0.0,0.933,0.067,0.2023,"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface, you can see the interface as modern or classical."

0.0,0.741,0.259,0.4215,"there is a clock, and date, which can get helpful."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"10.  the player has firmware, which will remove the glitches, if there are any."
0.0,0.674,0.326,0.8025,"11.  the music plays awesome, never skips, even if u run for a bit, so you can listen to music without interruption."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"cons:  1.  the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with, in this player, is the battery life."
0.0,0.815,0.185,0.3612,"the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours, and what i recieved was 6-8."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5 hours max.
0.0,0.757,0.243,0.7713,i did it like this  eax on: 6 hours eax off: 8.5 hours  2.  the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said.
0.0,0.95,0.05,0.3612,"3.  you need the software to actually transfer files  4.  the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on, 60 percent of the time, it sais, shutting down, which means i have to turn off, and turn it on again, which is not to my likings."
0.265,0.635,0.1,-0.4344,"also, the player sometimes freezes, not a very big problem, but can also be annoying."
0.084,0.732,0.184,0.5423,"(but as any hard drive, all of them freeze at certain points)  well thats about it, and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up, stil havent happened to me, and i hope it doesnt."
0.0,0.462,0.538,0.7906,"easy to use, massive storage space, sounds great."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"and also, it's priced very affordably."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player (everything music file i have is on there) with room for about 2,500 more."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,a similarily priced 15gb ipod wouldn't have been nearly enough room.
0.0,0.883,0.117,0.6249,having my entire music collection is great when travelling (both on plane and car trips) and i don't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it's all there.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage.
0.0,0.827,0.173,0.5569,"the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted."
0.155,0.729,0.116,-0.2144,the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones.
0.0,0.868,0.132,0.4404,on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference.
0.0,0.847,0.153,0.4404,accessing files by artist and album (i mostly look things up by artist) is easy and intuitive.
0.0,0.941,0.059,0.25,possibly the biggest advantage this player has (if price wasn't enough) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery.
0.055,0.945,0.0,-0.2732,"since batteries do run out on everything, this will also be a big money-saver since ipods, irivers, rca, dell, all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician (apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement)."
0.0,0.843,0.157,0.802,"try before you buy if at all possible: although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod, the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface."
0.0,0.865,0.135,0.2584,i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the ipod's white plastic look / surface doesn't suit me.
0.0,0.48,0.52,0.764,"i like the nomad's color better, but it's not terribly flashy."
0.092,0.822,0.086,-0.0516,the mini ipod's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"my advice to mp3 buyers: consider how much storage space you will need, then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them."
0.0,0.508,0.492,0.4404,good for the price.
0.0,0.784,0.216,0.5106,i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the pros:  price!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,almost half what an ipod would cost you!
0.232,0.768,0.0,-0.4973,i don't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me.
0.0,0.458,0.542,0.8576,"sound quality is wonderful, i really like the smart volume sound normalization."
0.165,0.678,0.157,-0.0258,yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough.
0.0,0.73,0.27,0.7424,i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,cons.
0.339,0.169,0.492,0.2263,creative software stinks.
0.778,0.222,0.0,-0.5423,it's horrible.
0.0,0.774,0.226,0.5255,redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more!
0.0,0.918,0.082,0.1779,the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i didn't notice after first day.
0.0,0.196,0.804,0.6249,great player.
0.0,0.64,0.36,0.6696,have had the player since xmass and love it!
0.0,0.651,0.349,0.9246,"pros:  great sound, very long battery life (i routinely play it for 12 + hours), very fast recharges rate, removable battery, storage size, nice screen, firmware updates, and great price."
0.0,0.816,0.184,0.6597,"cons:  short warranty (3 months, so i got the extended warranty at best buy), occasional freeze up (easily fixed by popping out battery), somewhat flimsy navigation wheel."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,neutral:  i didn't even try the included software.
0.144,0.789,0.067,-0.3182,"i just bought notmad manager ($ 25) and file transfers are easy drag and drop, songs stored by id3 tags not by folders, needs to have software on computer to transfer files, no window on case (nice case otherwise."
0.194,0.504,0.302,0.3612,i don't see what everyone's problem is - i love this player.
0.0,0.729,0.271,0.7717,"this is an excellent player, especially for the price, with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod."
0.061,0.746,0.193,0.7717,"for a price that's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster, and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some."
0.0,0.806,0.194,0.7184,"here are the pros and cons (few there are) in detail:  look / design:  the system is terrific in size and design, imo looking better than the ipods."
0.147,0.853,0.0,-0.4497,"it's bigger, but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods."
0.0,0.781,0.219,0.4215,"it's very solidly built, and has a nice dense feel to it."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least.
0.097,0.731,0.172,0.4548,"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod's as well, in that you don't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you're there."
0.0,0.676,0.324,0.34,the screen's large and easily read.
0.0,0.757,0.243,0.775,"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face, that sometimes comes off a bit easily, but besides that it's perfect."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"sound: exceptional, though i can't really compare it to the ipod."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,from what i've heard it's at least equal.
0.097,0.793,0.11,0.0772,"like others have mentioned, you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they're on lower bit levels."
0.167,0.833,0.0,-0.296,"there's no so-called background hiss that i've noticed, at least so far."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,interface - practically seamless.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags, which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver."
0.0,0.862,0.138,0.6059,yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order (with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out) it actually turns out to be really handy.
0.0,0.51,0.49,0.7717,"it's a dedicated music playing device, anyway, so this serves it better."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"you can find any song quicky by an artist, album, or genre search."
0.0,0.867,0.133,0.6297,"playlists can be generated on the fly (which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus) or by using the software, and there are a bevy of eq options."
0.18,0.82,0.0,-0.296,the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance.
0.0,0.702,0.298,0.8173,"software:  as i mentioned before, the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said, though notmad may still work better."
0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404,"it's easy to transfer, preview, and organize files."
0.0,0.597,0.403,0.6597,"the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point, as well."
0.38,0.62,0.0,-0.5994,it was no problem for me to use their software.
0.171,0.829,0.0,-0.4497,"some may complain that there's no drag-and-drop capability, but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player, not a computer accessory or hard drive."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience.
0.166,0.717,0.117,-0.3786,"overall, i'm giving this 5 stars as i've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over, but as i've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack, hissing, or scroll wheel problems show up with me too."
0.0,0.6,0.4,0.6115,"so far, however, i'm a very happy customer."

0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can't use nomad until you get home.

0.326,0.674,0.0,-0.5256,you will be very disappointed with this product.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups: (1) those who have had the product for a few weeks and (2) those have had the product for a few months.
0.0,0.818,0.182,0.4404,those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the price is way below an ipod of the same size.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod.
0.0,0.61,0.39,0.4927,the sound quality is very good.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"the controls are somewhat harder to use, and there are some oddities about the software tagging system, but most people can live with this."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"because of the large capacity of the nomad, owners can load hundreds of cds on to it."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"for most people, they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection."
0.0,0.78,0.22,0.4767,having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific.
0.0,0.588,0.412,0.6369,they fall in love with the product.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,and then it breaks.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires.
0.162,0.838,0.0,-0.4019,"typically, the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others."
0.0,0.707,0.293,0.4404,the nomad is sent back to creative labs.
0.096,0.749,0.156,0.25,"they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period, creative will charge you to fix it."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"in my case, the bill was $ 81, about a third of what i paid for it."
0.0,0.607,0.393,0.8127,"like many others, i had not abused the product, and had tried to take care of it."
0.079,0.817,0.105,0.2008,"if my level of care wasn't good enough, i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two."
0.078,0.854,0.068,-0.1027,"i'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed, and will not hold up to normal use."
0.278,0.722,0.0,-0.4019,the headphone jack seems to be a major problem.
0.0,0.915,0.085,0.4005,"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover, which is taken off to have access to the battery, seemed to come undone very easily."
0.18,0.82,0.0,-0.5106,the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire.
0.219,0.781,0.0,-0.6814,"even if it hasn't expired, creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it, and get used to having it."
0.34,0.66,0.0,-0.8503,"so when it breaks, as it will, you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad."
0.124,0.876,0.0,-0.1761,you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,you will have a very expensive paperweight.

0.0,0.863,0.137,0.6486,"most people say buy an ipod, but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops.
0.047,0.644,0.308,0.8271,"maybe creative will come out with a better design, although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again."
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,maybe more competitors will bring out similar products.
0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod.
