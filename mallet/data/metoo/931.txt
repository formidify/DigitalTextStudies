To look at where I am now and the fact that sharing will continue to give me strength and encouragement for others to also speak up. It took me over 30 years to speak up. Not because I did not know how but the transparency and closer that I needed. I was left alone to be improperly touched by a cousin. I knew it was not right but I never spoke up in fear of what my dad or brothers would do to him and they would get in trouble. So I stayed quiet. I was sleeping in my room and I  get another inappropriate touch in the middle of the night with my brothers and parents sleeping not far away. I keep quiet again out of fear of what would happen to them. At age 30 I decided to speak up and today I educate young girls and teens about sexual abuse as a topic along with the core of self esteem and how this effects ones self esteem.
