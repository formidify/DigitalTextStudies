 When I was 17 my 28 year old co-worker sexually assaulted me when I was fucked up on prescription meds. I didn't know it was sexual assault until 3 years later. Everyone at my work knew what happened but no one thought it was wrong despite being a minor. I never told anyone because i thought I'd be called a slut.
