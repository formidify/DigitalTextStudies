 I was molested, god i hate that word, for the first time when i was five years old by a boy who was at least ten years older than me. At least once a week for a whole year he would pull me into his room so we could 'play house', you know my mom freaked out when she found me changing in the same room as my cousin - a boy who has never treated me as anything other than a sister and yet she never questioned the fact that her little girl spent all her time with a teenager and she never questioned it a year later when that same little girl would scream every time someone tried to touch her. I ignored those memories and what they meant for 10 years until i fell into depression for the first time, i convinced myself that it didnt matter what happened to me because my body didnt matter and if my body didnt matter then i couldn't be molested - it didn't matter when boys groped at my chest, it didn't matter when an upperclasman stuck his hand down my shorts, and it didn't matter that the same man sat next to me on the city bus every morning just so he could touch my legs. I didn't matter, i believed that so completely that when boy i was friends with started making advances towards me i let, i allowed myself to be pulled into a toxic, emotionally abusive relationship where i was almost forced to use my virginity as a bargaining chip just so i wouldn't have to be alone. I only got to keep my virginity because he didn't have enough time to "finish what he started".
