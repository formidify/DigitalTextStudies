 It all started when I was 5. My mom said that me and brother had to sleep over her friends house. I woke up to her friends son touching my private. I cried and he left me alone because there was other ppl in the room. The next time my grandfather's friend pinned me up in a hallway, when I was coming outside to play and aggresively, rubbed his self on me  until this sticky stuff was running down my leg. I was so scared. He told me I better not open my mouth or he would kill my brother.. A short time went by, One day I was with gramps and he walked up , I guess my eyes and the fact that I pee'd on my self while standing there was a signal for my gramps, because when he took me to change my clothes, he asked me why did I do that? I started crying and told him what had happened. My gramps grabbed his ice pick and told me he'd be back.  I just kept hearing my Great Grand Ma saying " My only son is going spend the rest of his life in jail".  My gramps stabbed that man 40+ times with that ice pick... he died, but not immediately... I remember not seeing my gramps through the rest of my younger years until I was abt 12 When he came home.  My gramps died in '97. I have been raped since then, in my adult life but I never mentioned it until now , because I always felt by me telling, It caused someone to lose their life. I didn't want the same thing to happen again with the Males in my family by telling. I suppress it, but sometimes I see it in my dreams, or relive it while I'm driving,  talking , walking or just having a quiet moment with too much time to on my hands to think.. Thanks for letting me shareðŸ’–
