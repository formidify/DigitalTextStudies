This. This is the problem, don't stay silent! This needs to be heard! If you think you are brave for not saying me too, or you think your "metoo" won't really help, you are so wrong! Groping is not ok, someone caressing your arms isn't ok if it isn't wanted. No one should be touching your body unless they are invited by you to your body party. I can't say this enough, it'll only change if we make it visible to all! <3 all of you  survivors (men and women) stay strong, we will get through together, united not divided.
