I was a ward of the State  in the late 70s so no one came to my rescue . Or accepted that  what was  truly happening  was possible. The almost monthly rape and molesting started when I was  12 years old  and continued until I was 15.. Even at 60 years of age . I am still under the care of  a psychologist .To help me cope and stay alive . What is done to us as children by rapist  is not something that doesnâ€™t  matter . For Time will fade  its memory and forget .    That for me can never happen
