Finally got through to the court house to request the trial tapes. First they tried to tell me I had to get them through the DA.I said the DA is only giving me the charges and that he was found not guilty. Then they said I can request them online for $50!!!I also mentioned the DA threw the case. Only met with me a couple times in 5 years and did NOT object to the slanderous OFF TOPIC questions from the defense.The court also said I cannot write the judge, and I cannot file an appeal unless through the same DA that is so eager to throw the case and do nothing more ...
