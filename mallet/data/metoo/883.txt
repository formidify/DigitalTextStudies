Thank you for adding me!To painfull to describe...Where to start?To much & so many occassions where in more severe degrees it asked so much strengt of me. Changed my carreer opportunity’s as well for the bad.But it stil affects my Life now a days offently, as I am for that reason still alone!I can cope fairly now, But in my Life, man judge me as damaged good or Treath me for that reason cheaper than a woman whom did not survive all of these situation’s where I was beeing done wrong!Calling me a bordeliner in consequence as the truth is that PTSD show similar symptooms, but with love and time they fade away!But the Nice Guy’s always drop me Before the true healing and use it against me.Having ADD and beeing highly sensitieve doesn’t help either.How ironical, can it become!...Your oftenly punisched even more for beeing strong, after all!The hate is even stronger when Your beauty, purity of soul and kindness is still preserved!I was never the victim But the survivor!
