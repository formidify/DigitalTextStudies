When I shared my  story last week I didn't include everything. There is more to my story. Still trying to get up the courage to share the remainder of my story. But not quit there yet. After I shared part of my story last week I finally opened up to my mother about everything I have gone through. She has been here for me ever since I told her. Maybe soon I'll have the courage to share the rest of my story
