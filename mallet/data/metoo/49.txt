At one point I got brave and went to a lawyer. My mother knew him from church so I trusted him. I gave him all of my information. Shortly after he called me and asked me if he could come over and give me a back massage. I dropped it, this was in the 70s. My mom got mad at me for dropping it, I told her what happened and she hung up on me.
