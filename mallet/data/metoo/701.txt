when i was 8 years old my dad's friend (my god father ) was babysitting my brother and I. they were downstairs I was upstairs in my room playing a game. said guy came up to see what I was doing and sat next to me on my bed and asked if I'd like to play a different game. being a kid I agreed. he then molested me and made me touch him. he told me no one would believe me and it was our little secret. he even bought me toys etc to keep me quiet.  it took 2 years to tell my parents. they believed me and it went to court. he got probation. and when i saw him again aged 19 I froze and ran off crying thankfully hes dead now. however age 28 after my marriage broke up I met with someone from school. he would ask me to do things with him sexually I didn't want to do but instead of being a decent  human being he did them anyway. feeling so low about myself after a failed marriage I felt numb so he took advantage of that. and has since on a few occasions contacted me on Facebook acting like we are old friends. blocking didnt work he made a new account. I didn't report him because i felt defeated in a way.then I met my daughter's father who turned out to be violent. but even after all of this  im still here I have my daughter shes my blessing and I live for her. i am not a victim im a survivor
