Thanks for the add, I see a lot of strength here and feel empowered by that. Its been a long journey for me, many awful experiences starting at the age of four with a male babysitter, but I'm stronger, I've survived, I've found healthier people, relationships, and the love of my life in my amazing husband. I'm in a good place and very proud of that!
