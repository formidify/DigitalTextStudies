I have told my story but my story went on deaf ears. This happened to me while I was in the military back in 2002. I was new to my ship. We were in Orlando and my first class told our division when we go out to stay in groups which I did . when we all returned to the ship I went to the galley to make some ramen noodles and one of the shipmates who I knew and spoke to plenty of times asked me if I was tired I said no why he asked if I wanted to learn about the ship so I can get my sea qualifications I said sure.  He was an engineer so he knew about the part  the ship I didn't know about . he took me to  bottom of the  ship where the anchor was i didn't think twice about it. Once I got down there I had to crawl through some crawl space and then that's when it happened. I was raped and held down every  time I tried to fight him and push him off I either got choked or  my legs pushed down. I kept say stop and  he told me to stop fighting him that he was almost finished. So I stopped fighting. He told me  to go wash up.  I looked  down and there was blood every where.  I got  dressed went took  a  shower but saved my clothes. The next day I went and  someone.come to find out everyone knew about  it  and there were a group of men that  this to women on the ship  but no one ever came forward . I gave my captain my clothes they took me to do  rape kit . I spoke to a female jag  officer to report what happened and  question him. Our  stories matched and the jag officer told me  not to go through with  it  so I didn't and in the end he  got away with  and I was the  one  who got busted down in rank
