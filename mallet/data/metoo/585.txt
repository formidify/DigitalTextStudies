I am writing my memoirs as a tool for healing. Maybe it may help others to become Survivors. Part 33 !!! My mind is jagged  ! Remember  ?? The memories of a this little girl are scattered throughout the years. My memories are always in the colors of my mind. And the fragrances of the past. Sunrise brings a rush to my beating heart . The colors of the rainbows. Memories of the beautiful garden. The little Eden on the hilltop with the ramshackled green house and its  rusty tin roof . Holding tightly to the memories of generations .And the secrets that were never mentioned. Colors are always the wonderful things that were in our lives. And the darkness the blacks the greys. The days when the Sky doesn't supply my mind with the rainbows colors in the dawn of a new day. The greys and blacks are the only way to describe the things that my mind wonders back too. These are memories that should never exist.  For those things that happened to the jagged Little children should never have been allowed to be. I am going back to the dark place. I don't remember the year I was in , when I the nightmare of the sexual abuse started . In my third year ! Is my strongest darkest blackest memory. Such a pretty little fairy dress. My Nanna made it. But the body of the man with the tortured mind beside me and the stench of stale beer and cigarettes is to distressing for my jagged little mind to cope with even now in this my 53rd year. I need to go to the colors of the rainbows and sunrise. The place of Eden in my Grandfathers garden. The dark consumes me  !!!!! To be continued  !!!! Mamma lou x x
