I have discussed what happened to me as a child, that I was molested and raped by my uncle for my whole childhood, but have not been able to talk about what my now, ex-husband did to me.  I was married for 7 very long years.  Endeared hours of screaming at a time several times a week.  Fists flown my way every time,. Sometimes end table and dresser drawers thrown at me.  And the last year of our marriage, he would wait until I would fall asleep, I would wake up pinned down to the bed while I cried and begged him to stop, he would rape me.  I finally left him after I had attempted several times to take my own life.I am not writing this to get sympathy.  I am writing this to the women who are still in similar situations as I was.   Please don't do what I did.  Don't wait until you hate yourself and your life so much that you try to end it with suicide.  Please leave now.  While you have even part of your sanity.  He's not worth it.   If you have small children, do it for them.  He will turn on them with time.  I know it is a scarry to think about being a single mom.  But I found it so much easier when I didn't have a man raging on in the background as I did all the work of raising my kids.   I am here if you need to talk.  Pm me please. I care very much about you all.  I wrote a poem this last anniversary to help stop some horrific flashbacks, it did the trick.  I hope you don't mind if I add it here.Happy NOT AnniversaryA Love NOT PoemðŸ’”"I have built myself a happy lifeNow that I am no longer your Wife"Happy Not AnniversaryðŸ’”You were my mateBut only showed me hateAlways putting me downYou made my heart drownYou shoved my dignitySo Deep belowYou made my tearsever flowThere was always a problemThat only you could seeThat would make you rage onAnd freak out on meDown the hallway I would fleeTrying to break freeFrom the hateful manThat you only showed meYou told meI better know my placeAs you raged onAnd destroyed our sacred spaceAs I look backAt the years gone byOn which- youI did not relyI rebuilt my family lifeEver gratefulI was no longerYour wifeAs the years did flowI watched my 2 young men growLove and peace is what they knowVengeful words they will never sowI see todayAs I look backOn this lovelyMonth of MayMy family startedIn a horrific wayBut the 3 of usWalked awayIt was rough at the startBut with love in our heartThe 3 of us knewIf love we pursued Our smaller familyWould grow anew
