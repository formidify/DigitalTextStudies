I'm new to the page and I am a , like most of us here. I shared the tag, but not my story on my personal page. I have been sexually assaulted a number of times, most recently as a teenager by a trusted family friend. None of my attackers ever spent a day in jail, because I was scared/ashamed. I shared  because 1) I will no longer by silenced 2) I want other rape victims/survivors to know that they don't have to be ashamed - I received counseling and am currently IN therapy, and it has helped me in so many ways. 3) because I want all survivors and victims to know that not pressing charges doesn't render their assault invalid. It happened, and whatever your reasoning, you chose not to or couldn't come forward. And your well being is what is important in that moment. 4) I love how this has brought so many people together for the first time in a long time.
