I just responded to a post on the private group that I want to share here about the way people have reacted to her posts . . .   I understand your sadness and frustration, I have felt it to. what I can say is post for yourself without expectation. What do we want for ourselves, in ourselves?  I want to be at peace with me, I want to stop expecting anyone to understand and if I feel hurt, watch what it triggers in me.  We, who have experienced these things at times, overidentify with Victim - understandably so.  When I move out of that model I personally feel a lot better and I dont care about others .  I am a part of this group because I am I was sexually abused. like everyone else.  I want to sit with that and be apart of a sense of empowerment of being with others.  This happened to me as a young child it has conditioned my whole life.  I am 58 it has also given insight, compassion, the ability to go deeply and help others and much more.  I know my life would have been a whole lot happier had it not have happened . . . . with love and respect
