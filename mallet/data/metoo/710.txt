I first saw the  posts this morning while eating breakfast with my daughter. I thought to myself "How brave, I would never want everyone to know." The thought of publicly announcing the simple words "me too" made me feel sick and honestly a little ashamed. As the day went on almost every girl on my newsfeed had said "me too". Suddenly I had the courage to say me too. So thank you all for being so brave.I hope eventually everyone holding a silent "me too" will feel the same sweet relieve of letting it go that i have tonight.
