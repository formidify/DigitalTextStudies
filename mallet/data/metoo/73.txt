Today one of my co-workers attempted to squeeze into a tight space behind me he then grinded up against me. I tried to move but was forced to stay in that tight space until he decided to let go. He then approached me when  no one was around and started rubbing up against me trying to stick his hand in my shirt while whispering things like "do I make you nervous?" "Are you scared? " I said yes shaking in fear and walked over to my manager and told her to watch him because I didn't want to be alone with him. He spent the rest of the day violating me(slapping my butt, grabbing My butt, grabbing my chest) every chance he got and "remixing" popular songs and turn them into to songs about him "getting in between my thighs" and I spent the rest of the day watching my back hoping no one left us alone. I talked to my manager again about how uncomfortable he made me feel all day and she replied with "That's just how______ is He don't mean no harm.
