.  UPDATE:  After standing up to and exposing  my harasser... He sent me a letter of apology!      Yup - Bullies, Haressers, Abusers dont like being Exposed!                            Original message: Most recent was sexually harassed by local home builder "business" man.  He's so gross. I've been outing him a lot. To a lot of people. I shared his harassing phone message with a lot of people.  By acting and talking the way he did he basically trashed his own name and business name.  Thanks for those who have been brave enough to share on this site.  The more we expose our harassers/abusers  the less likely for it to happen again. I hope all people, adults and children, will report, speak out, and ask for help.
