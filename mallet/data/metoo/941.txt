I pretty much feel like my childhood ended when I was 11 years old once I reached puberty all the boys that I thought were my friends started to make  inappropriate moves towards me and I was not prepared to handle it my mother had never talked about anything like that I never spoke of it to her because I was ashamed and felt so dirty and didn't understand ...that sort of thing never stopped and now that I'm a strong adult woman I hope that I can set an example to my own daughters to always stand up for themselves I know they will never tell me everything that happens and that breaks my heart I wish we could reach Young girls before these horrible things happen... And as a mother of a son I have always been open with him that alcohol and relationships in a young age do not go well together... Although there is no excuse for sexual assault I do believe that sometimes with the younger people signals to get crossed when they are drinking and partying and the boys do not always intended to go poorly but they need to understand that no means no regardless
