1.  I was between 5 and 6 ..my mom and step dad had a friend stay over,he slept on the couch and when I came into the living room, he began touching me and I tried to move away ,But he put me between the couch and himself and began to touch...he never penetrated but after i refused to please him orally he let me leave...i didnt tell my mother until I was about 16....2. 12-  I had a boyfriend who became enraged that I wouldn't have sex with him and he grabbed me inappropriately and got a gun and tried to shoot me...i was lucky my brother was there,he saved me.3. I was 13- my brothers friend (really hot guy to me at the time) ...i gave it up willingly because I guess I thought he really liked me... But he started trying every time he saw me i started to find this frightening and told him no.. and he became aggressive with his attempts, one day he came into the laundry room and grabbed my hair, held me to the floor and just took it ...it hurt alot, he was biting me and pulling my hair out...he put all of his weight down on me , I couldn't yell for my brothers..i told them ..but because I had let him.in the past they didn't believe me so I never  spoke of it again...until a few years ago.4.  14- my uncle molested me while i stayed at my dad's house for the weekend... i woke up to being touched ,i woke up and got away and ran into my dads room when I told him he became enraged my dad ran him out with a gun and he has never forgiven himself for not preventing such a thing..my uncle was put in prison for it..that was my one victory for all of the others.....
