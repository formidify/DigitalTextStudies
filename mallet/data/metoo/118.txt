 sadly I have had to struggle with the rape, incest, and molest since I was about 3/4 years old all the way until I was 19, all by men that I thought were supposed to protect me and teach me and guide me. Because of it, I don't even think I can ever really trust a man. I have been married for 6 years (been together for 13) and it is really sad because my husband's features are exactly like my sperm donor (father). I attend a woman's group specifically for what we have gone through, and I am greatful because it helps remind me that I am not alone in my struggles. I read through a few stories on here, but it hurts too much in my heart and I start bawling to know that you had to go through it as well. Thank you for having me here.
