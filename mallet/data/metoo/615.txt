 #rapedrug. A few years ago i was living in sydney doing a gap year. I went out with a friend i met when i was living at the central coast and his brother. We went to a bar to have a few drinks. I was a little drunk but just chatty and not even close to being totally drunk. Next thing i remember is that i wake up the next morning without any cloth in the bed of my “friends” brother. He was already up sitting in the living room watching footy. I got dressed and just ran out... didnt look at him and pushed everything away from me not thinking about what happened. A month later I left Sydney without ever seeing him again, deleted him on facebook.. He never existed.It worked out really good until sometimes last year when i saw the post of his brother that he died in a motorcycle accident. He hit a tree and was dead immediately. In that moment I remembered what has happened.. all these years i just made myself believe that it was just a dream because i run away. During this time i was seeing someone.. he was there for me .. he was the first one i told what has happened. I know it is still blocking myself in many situations.. but at least i started to open up a bit in sharing and talking about it. And i was shocked. When i told a few others they started to talk as well..  so many of my friends have similar stories to tell.
