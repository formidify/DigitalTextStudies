I am trying to get my 18 year old daughter to understand all of the accusers. All of the brave women who have come forward. You see, when I was 14 my friends 40 something uncle tried to have sex with me. I was a Police Officer in Milan, Ohio where the Chief of Police made my life miserable because I would not left him touch me. I understand what all of this means. She has had the most wonderful sheltered life and can't see it. She seems to think that some of these accusers (both men and women) are just seeking attention. Perhaps some are, but the majority are sharing something truly painful. I am so thankful that she has not experienced the reality of the "man's world". And I pray that she never has to go through it. God Bless all of the accusers. Your are brave and strong.
