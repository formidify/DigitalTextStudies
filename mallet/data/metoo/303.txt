I watched SVU today about high school girls being vulnerable and one in particular was forcibly raped.  I am remembering my high school years-  In the late 70s I was 16 then 17 and used by several men because I was drunk and whatever.  Senior year it was gang rape because I coul not consent if they put knock out stuff in my beer.The whole statutes of limitations is on my mind.  I became worthless and was beaten, forcibly raped by a guy at least twice.  The second time it was in a room with all of his friends.  No one helped me.Now I'm 55, having led a horrible life, and on medication for the rest of my life so I don't kill myself.  I'm grateful for the opportunity to get it off my chest today!
