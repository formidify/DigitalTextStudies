 I was raped when I was 20 by a 17 year old male. I called a friend right after it happen and they convinced me to call the police. I actually got him arrested and he denied raping me (of course) and said it was consensual. I was also told by one of his friends that if I press charges they can say he is  under age and flip the charges on me ğŸ˜¢. I was young, scared and far away from my family and decided to drop charges.  Next day i packed and flew back home. I cried my eyes out for several days and never talked about it again.
