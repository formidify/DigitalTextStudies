Does any of your lovers, friends or family support your abuser by staying in a friendly relationship, or making weird comments like "get over it" "we could all be friends together" "i was not there" "it was a long time ago" ... ?Please help by giving your opinion as I would be grateful to know if it happened to you and how we could improve on this kind of painful situations, and think would help to talk about that part too.... Thank you
