I cannot begin to describe the rush of emotions that came with typing  on my status yesterday. It was almost 14 years ago when my body was first violated and I feared for my life. When a man I had looked up to as an older brother stripped away every bit of innocence and pureness of a child away. My parents sheltered me, not letting me go to school birthday sleepovers and surrounded me with people from church believing they were keeping me safe. Instead I was raised in a tiny circle that made me so naive... I didn't know a bit of sexuality or understand all the sexual innuendos that surrounded me... looking back I now realize all the signs I may have picked up if I was educated on my body and the different types of people that destroy our culture even when you rest upon a place that you believed to be your safety zone. My heart bares pain to see the countless people that have gone through a similar situations and countless degrees. My love goes out to you all and hope that you heal. Whether I know you or not, if you need someone to talk, I am here to be there for you, if no one else is.
