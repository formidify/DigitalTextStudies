Hello When I was 5 I witnessed two of my friends being sexually assaulted . I was to be next but my bro and his friend stopped it . I know this because I was told . I do not remember but only when I dream and have night terrors. It's haunted me .Then when I was a teenager my friends daddy groped me after he got me drunk . Thank God nothing happened . Also her cousin tried to rape me but I bit his tongue and got out of there . The last two incidents I didn't report because I felt like where was the proof . I didn't even tell my friend until 25 years after the incident. She was upset for me , she cried . We has a society of women don't report cause it's become a norm for these incidents. I hope it stops !
