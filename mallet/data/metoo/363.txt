I've been abused by several men since I was 4/5. When I was 16 my mother's boyfriend molested me for three days. He kissed me and pushed himself against me. Charges were filled but my mother hid him saying it was my fault. And she even asked me if I wanted it. I wouldn't talk to her for several months. And she made me keep it a secret. Only my therapist and my close friends k ew about this. My mom still doesn't believe me especially when I told her I was rapped when I was 4/5 by the neighbor boys older brother. I still have trust issues with men and it's messed with my life. Also when I was in elementary school two girls thought it would be cute to peek under my stall when I was using the bathroom over and over and over till one of the girls got a teacher. I was crying hysterically. When I was a sophomore in high school a guy that had a pregnant gf also my friend decided it was ok at lunch time to touch me down there. With a lunch room full of kids while I was surrounded by my "friends" nobody said a word and I had to go to the principal by my self. And the most recent thing to happen was a 70 year old man grabbed me from behind at my old job and pushed himself against me. I locked eyes with the security guard and he looked the other way. I reported it but nothing was done since I didn't know his name. I have trust issues and I mostly stay to my self now. This hurts and it really sucks. But I've learned what to look out for. I just hope I can feel safe again.
