To the list of symptoms we cope with but don’t talk about-how about the way we tell ourselves it’s just that they wanted you so bad because they are so attracted to you. Like they didn’t mean for it to be what it was, like your brain trying to twist it into a compliment just so it’s more ok.     And then at some point in your life you’re going to go through a “dry spell” and your self worth plummets even further, because now that feeling that you were attractive and that’s why it happened, it’s a compliment that’s why, and when you confided in trusted family they were jealous and that’s why they didn’t believe you, not their fault, it’s a compliment really, none of it was because you were worthless, it’s because of your value that it happened, people take because something is wanted, they don’t take garbage with force-that’s been spinning in your head to cloud the issue and dull the edges-suddenly fractures when no one wants you.     The lie you’ve told yourself loses its power, now you are just broken trash not worth life itself and all the tape you’ve been putting on it over the years to hold yourself together, it shreds and tears the skin off with it. The comforting murmurs of its ok, it’s a compliment, become screams of you’re fucking shit and always have been. And now no one wanting you has thrown you lower than you ever were before.   Anybody else?
