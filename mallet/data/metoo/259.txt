When I was eighteen, my foolish ass was on the streets of SLC, UT, running amok, in doleful pursuits of discovering myself. The first night of my being on the streets, three guys approached me. They asked me my name and I suppose I must have asked their names as well, though I have zero recollection of it. The unfortunate thing is that I was extremely high off of a vicious drug called spice. If any of you know what that drug is, you know from the start that my night would already be on a road of deterioration. I got in the car with them, blissfully unaware of my fate in a few short hours. I will refrain from delving into the gruesome details, but long story short, I smoked more, they made me drink something, I don't know what it was, and I fell in and out of consciousness. I woke up a few times during the heinous actions of my perpetrators-there were three for certain, though more guys were in the hotel room so who really knows for sure? Due to my inebriation, I blamed myself. If I hadn't done the drugs, ran away from home, this never would have happened. But God has helped me tremendously through my healing process and He reminded me that through my pain, I would help others. Pain in this life is inevitable. But I constantly tell myself that it is bigger than just me. I go around sharing this story and others to reach those in the darkness and agony; asking why such an awful thing would take place in your life, in hopes of showing you that hope indeed still exists.Stay up, my friends. ‚ù§
