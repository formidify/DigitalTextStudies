I've never really told anyone about my assaults so this is a real weight off my shoulders. I was 13 and it was at homecoming. My friend set me up with a senior. He was 18. I danced with him all night then he made me go to his truck. After I was so embarrassed I called my dad to pick me up. I told my family I got my period because my white dress had blood on it. I blamed myself for so long because of the way I danced etc. I lost my virginity that night and became very promiscuous. I hated myself. My second assault was my ex husband. He never took no for an answer. I struggle to this day with not feeling good enough.
