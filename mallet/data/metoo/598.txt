I feel this is important because not many understand what a lot of our population goes through and how it affects them, and with that ill share my story.The first time i was raped i was 5, i blocked a lot of it out until therapy a few years ago where i was forced to remember all of it and it made me feel so empty inside. When i was 6 my mom was gone somewhere and my dad was in jail and my grandmothers boyfriend beat us both. After that life went on till i was 11 years old my grandmothers boyfriend molested me. I woke up to his hands on me while he was touching himself. No one ever did shit about it. In january 2015 3 boys forced themselves on me when i was homeless and thanks to that i deal with ptsd and my anxiety has doubled. February 4th my birthday my dad hit me and told me to kill myself and called the cops and reported me for a suicide attempt and i spent all night in the hospital alone on suicide watch. And the years between when i was 11 until that birthday my dad was drug using and super abusive to me and my mom. My parents left me behind for drugs and i have no family left to live with or talk to about anything. I feel extremely lost. And i cant even cry anymore ive come so numb to the pain but inside the memories eat me alive. Im only 17.Its okay if you dont want to share your story. But dont be afraid to atleast say me too.People need to understand how much their actions affect others lives.
