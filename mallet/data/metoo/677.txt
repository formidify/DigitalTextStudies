I was in fifth grade when my moms (now ex) boyfriend began molesting me. She was at work and he coaxed me on to the couch with him to "cuddle and nap". I fell asleep and woke up to The Simpsons playing on TV and him molesting me. From there on out, he would sneak into my bedroom in the middle of the night. I can still smell the beer on his breath,I can still hear his heavy breathing, I can still feel his touch. He had attempted to rape me one night, dragging me into the bedroom, throwing me on to the bed, and trying to rip my pants off. I screamed so , hoping and praying somebody would hear me. I fought so hard he gave up , hugged me, and apologized. But it never stopped. He continued sneaking into my bedroom every night, peeking  under the bathroom  door when I showered. I finally spoke up in seventh grade. We went to court.  But I never got justice. He is still roaming the streets.And I will  never back down. I will scream my story from the rooftops until we as SURVIVORS start getting the justice we deserve. You are not alone. We are not victims, we are survivors!
