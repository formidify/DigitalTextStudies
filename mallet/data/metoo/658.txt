From the forced sex when he mistook NO! for well, okay...to the vulgar comments and disgusting, demeaning suggestions...to the guys who think it's just fine for them to touch my hair (when I wear it down) and invade my space...to the guy insistent on giving me his phone number - pinning me against a counter and sticking the note with his name and number in my bra! Yeah, ME TOO. I always wonder: do they treat their mother...their sister...their wife...their grandmother with such DISRESPECT and DEPRAVITY?
