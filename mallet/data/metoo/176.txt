 My mom got married when I was 4. My real dad didn’t have rights anymore so the guy who married my mom adopted me and became my dad. (I love him so much). My (now) dad’s son was 7 years older than I was. He was so “cool” as he was always the one who knew things... many things.. that he could “teach” me to do... but I couldn’t ever tell the parents as he said it. It was hard to ever tell my parents but it did eventually come out when I was 17. I told one of my boyfriends at the time and after we broke up he politely told my parents.... not the way I ever intended on telling them... but I’m glad it did come out... It went to court but in the end my family still sees him as my brother. I have officially been out of the house and married for 4.5 years. Nothing has ever been done or no one has ever apologized... it’s so hard to take an apology never given and act like nothing ever happened...
