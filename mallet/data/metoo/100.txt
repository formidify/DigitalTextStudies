When you loose someone you love it in a weird way brings back memories of the times I was abused and abanndoned. Its like it triggered those memories of it happening with know one there to protect me. the loss of my dad has been harder then I thought it could ever be. And keeping it together for my kids being a single mom is hard. Has anyone experienced grief like this? Its hard to even sleep I find myself even at a loss for words with God.
