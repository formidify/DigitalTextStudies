On different occasions ... I kept quiet bc I was ashamed ... I was a smart girl that wasn't outgoing... But was told by older guys at age 15 that this is what you're supposed to do.... It wasn't enough for him but his friend also... I couldn't tell my mom bc I was ashamed.  She was hurting bc my dad had passed and she was trying to figure out life as a single parent without his income.  That was the first time...  Next was in college and when I spoke up it literally turned into a my word against his... And the authorities laughed it off.... The last time was meeting someone from a dating site last year... He happened to be an officer of the law... So naturally I assumed a good guy.... I was totally wrong.... Met him we talked and all seemed fine... Then he used the fact that he was a cop to place me in an uncomfortable situation. Since then I am not into online dating... And I really keep to myself more.... I'm extra protective of my children bc I know sexual assault happens to both males and females... I don't want them to EVER feel like I felt on any of those occasions.
