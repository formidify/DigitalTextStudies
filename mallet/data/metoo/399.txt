I was scolded for my post i made yesterday on fb... My own grandmother told me i was a horrible person for bringing that to the light...but i had to let her know through tears that due to her neglect...SHE was the horrible person for allowing her son to molest me for 5 years even after she knew about it....13 years ive held that in...13...it hurts like hell to not be accepted and completely ostracized from your mother's side of the family for something that wasnt your fault....
