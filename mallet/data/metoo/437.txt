Iâ€™ve never shared my story with anyone. But I was raped 17 years ago while attending a Christian college by a friend. He used date rape drugs in my drink, and at the time (2000) I did not know anything about those or fully understand what had happened to me. I just knew that I passed out in his car and woke up to him raping me then taking me back to my dorm.  I never told anyone because I was ashamed and my overly religious mother would have been so embarrassed. ðŸ™„ Isnâ€™t that a shame?  Anyway, it feels good to let it out now.
