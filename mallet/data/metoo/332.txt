Hiya there everyone xFirst of all, I think this is a fantastic idea, for everyone to share their stories so their confidence can grow, they can vent in a safe and constructive place/way and be reminded of of the fact that they are by no means alone in their suffering.On to my story; it began when I was too young to remember. All I know is that the abuse ended when I was somewhere between 9 and 10.There were two predators; the first a woman, who my earliest memories were among my first, when I was only 3 years old.The second was a man that I'm pretty sure she sold me to (she used to go upstairs with him sometimes herself and when they returned I remember money being exchanged.) Again, I can't remember when the abuse started with him as it was such a young age, but I'd put good money down on the age of 4. (That's when I started to associate 'Big ears' from Noddy with him as they looked a little similar. Lol) For most of my adult life I've been struggling with this unprocessed trauma and consequently borderline personality disorder and CPTSD. I have only really begun to truly heal and move on in the last couple of years or so, after years a rigorous self - analysis, research into my conditions and feeling as though I've been living in a horror movie of fresh and all the more painful flashbacks, recollections and realisations. (I don't think in such dramatic terms anymore. Lol, but it really did feel that horrifying for a large amount of time.)Although I've been through my fair share of abuse, I do feel very blessed as, despite it all, I have been raised by loving and caring parents that have made life at lot more pleasant and easy for me than it could have been. I know a lot of people that have been exposed to that level of abuse in early life often have no mentally/emotionally healthy or reliable caregivers, which was, very fortunately, not the case for me. Thanks for giving me the chance to share my story, I guess the only other thing I'd like all of you survivors to know is that, that is just what you are, SURVIVORS, not victims (though I know it can feel that way a lot of the time.) Your not broken, your a beautiful piece of art, like the Japanese philosophy of Kintsugi. And your not s****ed up, your a WARRIOR! 💯😜😘😎😍😇🏋️🥊👍🥂🌈💞
