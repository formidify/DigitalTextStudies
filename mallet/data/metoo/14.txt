One year ago I was accepted into an university to study forensic science. I never knew how much my life would dramatically change going there. Never knew how many could "be my friend" but in the time in need they laid in bed with the person who sexually assaulted me.  A year ago I was accepted into an university who did nothing but put the guy who assaulted me on academic probation,  even though he admitted to doing it. Nine months ago I decided to leave that university because I no longer felt safe. Almost a month ago I graduated from community college with an associates in criminal justice,  where I promised myself I'd support any juvenile who is in the system that is a survivor of sexual abuse.
