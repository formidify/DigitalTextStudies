Hello everyone, I'm currently working on an art project dedicated to everyone who ever suffered sexual abuse and I'm looking for people that would be willing to share their story. The project consists of 2 components one would be an audio recording of person's story and second would be me taking some pictures of the person (you don't have to show your face or reveal your identity if you are not comfortable with it) (the project is being shot in Montreal). Everyone is welcome to participate since I believe that it is important for everyone's story to be heard, not only to help fight sexual abuse, but also to support people that are currently struggling and feel alone in their struggle.On another note if you want to share your story but feel like doing it yourself is too much or you don't live in the area you can message it to me anonymously (in text or audio form) with the understating that it might be used in the project. The project is intended to be shown in museums. We are strong together. Thanks, J.
