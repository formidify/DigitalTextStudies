Thank you all for messaging me and sharing your stories! I feel touched by all the amazing women you are, and proud for seeing your courage to speak up. I've messaged those who have reached out asking for a video interview. I'll try to make as much time as possible to speak in person with each one. And I'll send you the result of this project via private message and post here. This has been a tough, but inspiring day. Thank you again! Sending you all lots of love <3 Original post:Hi everyone.
