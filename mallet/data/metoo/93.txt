Mine is easier box and shove into the dustbin. I acknowledge others who have survived much worse.It was my 12th or 13th or14th birthday. I was freshly pubescent. The primary party for our birthdays was always with extended family. This uncle asked me if I had gotten my birthday spanks--this was a thing still in the early 1970s. Although I my father had lightly done so when I was a young child in passing, I told this Uncle, with his kids waiting gleefully, I was too old. The three chased and cornered me in livingroom--the rest of crowd was in the adjoining kitchen. This uncle put me over his knee, my dress flew-up and he walloped me hard on my buttocks, underwear for all too see while my cousins cheered.I spent the rest of that day in my bedroom. My young mind trying parse out whether I had the right to be angry or to feel violated, who to be angry with, or whether I was the problem for causing a disturbance by not going along from the get-go.
