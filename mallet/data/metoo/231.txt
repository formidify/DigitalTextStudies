It began with a close member of my family who had to face many sexual harassment and rapes by the same man in her childhood. She tried to teach me how to be careful and not to trust anyone easily.One day, I was nearly 10 years old, I was walking down the street, her hand in mine, and a man looked at my legs while he was walking. It was quite stressing, I turned back my head and he was still looking at my skirt. She explained me why. It scared me.At 12, she teached me what a rape is. This conversation made me stronger than my school’s friends which were so ignorants !During all my childhood, I had to face many time the very same old creepy situations in the bus, street, train... like it was normal for everyone around me ! and my first time was a mess, forced to do something I wasn’t ready for just because I was 15, I was quite drunk and so was him, he justified his act in his head just like that : she drunk too much vodka, she stayed in the woods with me when everybody has left, I have to shag her, that’s correct right ? Just as some of you girls, I thought I was just good for sex when guys stared at me at this time. Party all the time, drugs, alcohol, more dirty episodes, probably in order to pass over it in a corner of my head. Now, I’m happy with a good guy who doesn’t see the world like these assholes, he makes my happiness every single day since 5 years and I do not think like that anymore. But, in a way, I’ll never forget it.
