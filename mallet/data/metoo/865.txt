 I've edited this post because I did not know it was open for everyone to come in and read. I don't want the whole world knowing the details to my story. Just to show that there are a lot of women out there who have suffered. Please be respectful to women. You have no idea what we might have been put through. You also have no idea how much strength it takes us to go through our days walking on eggshells so we don't wake up our past and it play with and twist our minds making us an unbearable broken person that no one knows how to deal with. Although I do not wish to share the details of my story I will say that it is an everyday struggle to remind myself that the man I'm with now and love unconditionally is not one of the many men who have abused me. I'm hard to deal with because sometimes I forget and become afraid of him. It's not his fault and it is unfair to him to have to deal with that but for now he chooses to and for that I am very grateful. I am strong. I am going to beat this!!!!
