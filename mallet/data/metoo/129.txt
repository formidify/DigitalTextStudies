  I was assaulted in 1999 by my boyfriend at the time.  He was drunk & angry as always, and I was what he decided to take it out on. He held me down on my stomach & pinned my arms. He then forced himself inside me, anal b/c he new how much I hated it. I screamed for help b/c we had roommates but no one came.  When he finished I discovered quite a bit of blood.  He then told me it felt like fucking a whore & left for the rest of the night. It  may sound really stupid but it took me a long time to be able to label it as rape, I was young & naive & I thought it couldn't be rape if u had already had sex with the guy & were in a relationship. I also had two other attempts, one by a guy from the club in 1998 luckily a friend intervened  & stopped what was happening.  The more recent one was in 2015 when I was drugged at a bar I was at for a friends bachelorette party.  I was only there an hr & only had one drink to toast with my friend otherwise i only had coke to drink, I was supposed to be the DD.. Someone must have slipped something in my drink  b/c I got sick, everything became distorted,  I couldn't see straight or clearly & my friends found me incapacitated in the bathroom.  Luckily I had friends I came with who came looking for me.
