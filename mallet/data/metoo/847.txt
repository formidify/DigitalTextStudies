I was 4 years olds... most kids first memories is of a family vacation but mine was of me being touched by my moms boyfriend at the time. I had no clue what he was doing just knew I did NOT like it.  That had a major effect on me, I started to use drugs had ALOT of sexually partners. I put it away for so long that I didn't even think about it, all I cared about was staying high so I didn't have to think about it. It was til I called my ex husband (he knew about it) and asked him if he would keep our daughter coz I was getting help that I needed, I was no longer letting it slowly kill me. So I went to rehab and started to talk about it. We did a family session and that's when I told my momma and daddy. My daddy was ready to kill him and my mom didnt believe me until I told her about his dick not being circumcised, that's when she believed me. I now have 4 years of being clean and I'm in a happy and healthy relationship. I'm NOT a victim but a Survivor! Always remember we are not a victim but a survivor!
