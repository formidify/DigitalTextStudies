I was sexually abused by my sisters exhusband.I was 14 when they met and he harassed me and my friends several times which ended up with me being raped three times when I was 15-16 years old.I kept it secret for many years, then I began to feel mentally exhausted and went to see a counselor which advised me to write a letter to my sister. I wrote her a letter and told her everything, but she obviously couldn't deal with it.We didn't see each other for many years, now she's divorced but still can't understand that what happened destroyed my life a lot...It destroyed my way of looking at life with innocent eyes and it was hard for me to trust men....I am soo relieved now when I can talk openly about this and share my story.😍I would like to give many hearts of love to my two daughters who had to live this through me..they give me courage and strenght. Thank you, Love Mum❣️ 💞💟💗 💝💟💗💞💝A heart to my mother who finally has understood my pain 💟And a big heart to the man I love who has made me understand that good, innocent and honest love still  exist's ❤️💑❤️
