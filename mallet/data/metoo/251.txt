Hi .I joined this group and posted # me too .to help show the enormity of the problem...  .I am one of the lucky ones . I had counselling  and also was in a group for survivors of sexual abuse . This was an amazing help . I feel I was lucky as I don't think there are to many groups like this country wide . It was completely confidential . And we all trusted each other.  Sadly that group has now been disbanded . But  I had previously left .as I felt I was ready to leave .  I still came out kind of public with me too . But felt unsure about doing so . I have moved on . Have made amazing friends through the group .   But the feeling of not being believed will all ways hurt .  So I had help and make the most of every moment I have now .  . Someone contacted me from this group on messenger but I did not reply and the link has gone . So sorry I missed that ....hence my long text now . Sending love to all of you xx
