#mentoo I've been debating whether to say this, fearing possible retaliation. It's might not be popular or well received, but I want to say something. I know I received so much support for my story and I love y'all for that.The not believing problem is especially bad for male victims such as myself. I have listened to so many men and women say that men can't be victims. I can't say I've ever heard of a case where people actually believed the man off the bat. Recently in one of my CJ classes, I said " he or she" in regards to sex crime victims and a woman blatantly said that men can't be victims. Her reasoning was that men always enjoy it when a woman forces herself on him and that it be can't be rape since the woman has to use a tool to threaten and overpower. Obviously, this really upset me, I cried in front of my class and mentor as I argued.A few weeks prior at my campus a male student was groped and no one believed him. So many people called him a liar and said it was for attention. I felt so bad for him and backed him every chance I got.During the summer at work, I wore shorts(I work outside and was within dress code) for the first time and two female coworkers started touching my legs all over, above and below the knees without consent. I got upset and they were baffled on why I reacted like that. I told a male coworker and he said that I should've enjoyed it because they were 'attracted' to me. This has been eating at me for awhile and I just wanted to get it off my chest.
