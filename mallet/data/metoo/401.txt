have any of you thought of the 15 yo girl (now woman) who came out about Trump sexually assaulting her in Jeff Epsteins place? she tried to come out to talk and she received death threats. #ibelieveHer never doubted her, even when she used Jane Doe, and a wig and glasses in her TV interview, and my gfs poo'd on the report as false, the court papers false. that female falls into the category of 'not considered credible source' bc she was with prostitutes. she reports she was attending a party. she was a runaway. maybe, there were prostitutes. maybe, there was ETOH. there is no maybe about a GIRL reporting a man tied her to a bed and penetrated her w/o her consent. that report is social suicide, for her...even fearing murder by angry strangers, in denial. Maybe, there IS a tape-after all Epstein made many TAPES!
