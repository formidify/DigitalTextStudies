This is hard for me to put out there but here it goes. At the age of 10years old Iwas sexually molested by a boy that went to the same school as I and he was about 4 or 5 years older than I was at the time. That continued for about 4 months til I got the courage to tell someone to keep him away. I didn't tell them why though. Then a few years later when I was 14 years old I was sexually assaultedâ€‹ by my then boyfriend in the gym at the high school I was going to at the time. About a year later I was sexually assaulted and raped by someone I thought was my friend. I went to his house next door one day with my brother and my brother went home for a little bit and I thought I'd stay and hangout when he forced himself on me. Not many people know any of these things. And it makes it hard for me to trust men. And these things have gotten in the way of some of my relationships in the past. I didn't tell anyone thinking it was my fault and that I would get in trouble. I now realise I did nothing wrong and now I am 20 years old and trying to get past what I have been through.
