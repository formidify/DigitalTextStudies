Meto was molested by a teacher when I was in preschool and when we were gonna testify the other little girl wouldn't do it . It has changed my  life and I see it now that I'm older , when I was younger I was always looking for any attention from men. I started having sex at an early age also and regret being worried about that stuff , but now that I'm older I'm mad how he damaged me at such an early age . But I don't let it stop me from living.
