This is a hard post for me  share but I feel like I need to share it.At age 16 I was molested by a man from the church I grew up in. Which lasted for 2 years I was always a small guy and I was full of fear. At age 20 I entered into a marriage that I was constantly being cheated on and viciously verbally abused lasting 10 years and I was still fearful. Went from that marriage to another vile marriage where I was also verbally abused and cheated on. I was also full of bitterness. That lasted almost 5 years. During this time I had turned to addictions, pills, anything that would help me sleep. During this time I had also tried to overdose and kill myself 36 times. But God. Yes I said but GOD. When I fully surrendered to God he took that hurt, he took that pain, And gave me joy. And he gave me peace. And he let me know that I am loved. Sexual abuse can happen to anyone, but there is only One that can truly heal you from your pain.
