What I wish I could say to those who raped and sexually assaulted me:I can feel your hands all over my body. I can feel my mouth blocked shut by your sweaty hand, your  grip strong like a vice. I can feel his weight on my arms, holding me down, bruising me, the pain of forced penetration. I can hear your breath as you pant down my neck. As it comes to the second time around, I'm floating away from the horrible place in which I am still trapped in. I can't remeber enough but I remeber too much. You have given me the life sentence you will never have! You should be behind bars you sick sad excuse of a person! You don't even deserve a title in this society. I constantly feel dirty and can never get clean. You gave me PTSD from the traumas you caused. I tried to escape through self harm and suicide attempts but I could never escape your grasps.
