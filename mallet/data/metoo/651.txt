 Domestic violence is a dirty little secret. For every woman who gets away, there are many more who work very hard to hide their pain in plain sight.  When someone shares their story of intimate partner violence we need to believe them. We need to accept them and their brokenness without flinching. She isn't flinching anymore and neither can we. We need to help them and provide them with the resources they need to find their voice and take back their life. #SurvivingIsMySuperPower
