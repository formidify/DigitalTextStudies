.  Were sexually assulted by my own father for a few years up until last year and im 45.   He let me felt like a child and im a grown woman. Couldnt stand up to him, to afraid.  How many times i wanted to scream at him and tell him what the helll is wrong with you but then i just walked away.. and every time i just carry on as if nothing happened.  Who would believed me anyway.  Its been more than a year now that ive decided im not going to see  or talk to him anymore.   He is NO  longer my father.  Ive got peace in my heart.
