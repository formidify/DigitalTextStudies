How do I begin? A man was hired to be my boss.. he made crude comments, made me stay late at work... told me about dreams he had about “being with me.” He kept Penthouse magazines in his office... and made sure I saw them..Once, he made me think we were going to investigate a problem at a work  site and wound up taking me to a hotel restaurant, to celebrate my birthday. Thank God the chef there was a friend and came to sit with us and read my GREAT discomfort... and sat with us the whole time.Other times, I was cornered in my office.. he was between me and the door... a surprise visit by his boss got me out. I went to HIS boss and told him what was going on.... his response: “He’s got good taste!” 😡After that, things progressed, I took another tact and allowed the creep to overhear me telling coworkers about his “dreams” and started laughing about him “dreaming the impossible dream.” Then my life really became hell.. he tried to get me fired, but I was able to prove the alleged problems were because I was following his orders and had sent the VP of the company a detailed report of the things I was being told to do (by said creep, because they were so bizarre and unethical, and the VP asked me to write things down and give him a report)what problems would arise by doing them. Thank God I kept a copy because the VP had “no recollection “ of that report... but I did and produced it... saving my job... but I was DONE... I finally told my husband that I was quitting my dream job and why it turned into a nightmare. My husband was ready to assault him, but I knew it was t the answer.. I cried my heart out, but wrote my letter of resignation. The next morning, when I was ready to face Hell at work, I arrived only to find out that he was fired... I was never told why he was fired, but got apologies all week from the VP and the creep’s boss...
