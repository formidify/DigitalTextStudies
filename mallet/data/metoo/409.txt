FYI- 's. Search - #Ihave - to find confessions. I can feel the black cloud lifting, the shame lifting, the Silence Was deafening. More like heavy traffic, rush hour, right now. We are on the news, daily now. This is just a tiny step, with the #HowIWillChange posts, we need lawyers and judges to hear our voices..so they can say #IBelieveYou for justice without shame and social suicide for victims. To get our POWER back. LIVE beautiful lives w/o the ugly.
