It was 1998 and i went clubbing with my friend. We got wasted and i lost her in the club. So i called my friend To pick me up. I used To Call him my brother and he always introduced me To his friends as his sister from another mother. Once at his place i passed out.I woke up because he was inside me. I passed out again.I dont know how long i was out but i heard another  voice and then that man was inside meI woke a few hours later half dressed between them sleeping. I went To the washroom, vomited, got dressed and ran out of there.I said nothingIt was my fault because i got drunkIt was my fault because i went To sleep in his bedIt was my fault because i didnt (couldnt) say no #nolongeravictim  #iamstrongnow
