 Hello everyone. I have had a lifetime of incidents. As young as as memory starts to record traumas. I'm adopted so some offenders were adopted related.. But most were dating or relationships related most recent was my ex that dosed me on meth for about almost a year. At his parents house in his dirty room on a dissolving matress he had me so ruined dosing me all weekend But I said No! And squirmed and pushed back but he was stronger flipped me and raped me. He finished and turned into the angriest side I ever saw I asked to go home he refused to take me it was late. He did take me to a local hotel but his smoking got me flagged. I went back to his parents house but was panicking I walked streets I didn't know alone dosed up on meth completely setup for the pd to pick up. He stole my caid and charger so I couldn't get home. But I carried xtra batteries called my co parent and travelled to pick me up standing alone on my ex's streer corner.. He went silent day after and got involved with a cousin of his he connected with online maybe here or the other 1000s of apps he is on.. He sent me pictures of them the whole family accepted this inter family dating. He texted me about sexual issues he was having with her I kept blocking him but he hacked my network years ago and only device. He also sent me a nude image from his car at work on break. Why would I want to see the instrument of my destruction ever again and a smirk picture of his face.. Then he tells me his cousin is how I was when we firsr met clean sober independent social. He turned me into an addict rapes me on occasions. And no regrets just texts he hopes she can get him sober like I tried for a year.. This is insanity. But proving relationship rape and dosing aftermath is hard. And I'm in fear he knows everything. Thank you for reading.
