- Crude comments and lewd gestures in workplace directed at my anatomy- Friend's father put his hands down my pants and tongue in my mouth- Asked on a date to movies - guy parked behind movie theater and groped all over me and was pissed off I said no. Then drove me to his house and tried again. Walked 4 miles home.- Cat calls, wolf whistles never ending comments about what they could do to me and make me feel.- Several male acquaintances trying to jam their tongues down my throat at one point or another.It really was never ending in the 80s when I was 15-25
