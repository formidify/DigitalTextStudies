I was abused from three to eleven by a cousin from my mom. I was thirty when I told my mother. He threatened to kill me, when I was fourteen.  I was raped at the age of 15 and again when I was 17. I thought it is all my fault. Obviously, I have something on me that forces men to treat me like that.I never got married or have children, as no men, I had a relationship with wanted to guarantee that he can prevent our child from this experience.Teresa Petterson, I can only congratulate you on how you cope with that.Whenever, I smell beer and cigarettes today on a man, I get aggressive and leave......I am not a victim anymore but it definitely has influenced my life and had an impact on my decisions.
