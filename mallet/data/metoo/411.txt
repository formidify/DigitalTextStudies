Usually the victim is afraid to confront for getting hurt forgetting that hurt is already inflicted by being abused. If you don’t confront you will continue to getting hurt. But if you confront then there is possibility that further hurt is stopped for you. It may even stop him/her from hurting other innocent people.First time a far away older cousin tried to touch me I didn’t know how to respond except I knew what is happening is wrong. So I ran and kept avoiding him. Eventually threatened to expose him. Which stopped him from bothering me but he switched his target to another girl. Second time my father’s friend tried kissing me forcefully during a family event taking advantage of darkness I screamed and told everyone what he did. He tried refusing but my father didn’t trust him. He was immediately given the consequences. This made me strong. Thereafter I could read the signs of abuser and not just kept myself away but spoke with people around him, making it very uncomfortable for him to continue. Fortunately my parents were very strong people and trusted me and protected us. We need to educate parents on how to protect children. But worst is when parents themselves abuse children. Child feels extremely helpless is a parent is abusive or supports / allows abuse.
