I know I'm well read. I know I appear confident. But these things do not stop sexual assault. There was nothing I could have done. There was nothing I should have done. The only thing thing I wish I had done was report the incident to the police so other people didn't suffer after me. If you are a victim of sexual assault please do not be afraid afraid to contact the police and someone you love and trust for support.
