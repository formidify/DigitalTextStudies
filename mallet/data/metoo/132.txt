 #MentooI'm sure I'll be the oddball, but I'm a man and I'm a victim of sexual assault and sexual harassment. I fell victim to a stranger when I was ten years old when I was in the hospital, I didn't say anything for eleven years. I was also sexually harassed when I first started my job by another man, it lasted for several months.
