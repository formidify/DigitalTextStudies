It lasted for 13 hours. It started with being pistol whipped and dared to reach for my revolver. I refused and said I would do what every he wanted so if he killed me it would all be because he really wanted to.  I would not give him a reason. This, in the eyes of the MP on base, was consent. This is what they used to threaten me with filing a false report if I did not drop the charges against one of their own.  It was not the first time someone had gotten away with this.  I was 8, he was my grandfather’s best friend.  He would come into my room at my grandfather’s house. This is where I stayed for the summers. He would visit for a couple weeks each summer.  I slept on the top bunk which was easy access for him to play.  I told my grandfather what he was doing but it didn’t stop until I made it stop.  I threatened to cut his off with a pair of sewing scissors. He never touched me again.  And some wonder why I was so vocal when my husband strangled me. I was told I was putting down a close friend, that I should keep it to myself, that it should not be discussed in public.  I should stay SILENT. I learned over the years that silence gives them power. I will never be SILENT AGAIN!
