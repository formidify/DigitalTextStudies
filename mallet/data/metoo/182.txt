About 4 years ago I went to Nashville to take my state board test so I could become a hairstylist. I called a old time friend and asked if I could stay with him so I didn't have to leave Martin at 5am.  So I got there and we hung out, ate dinner, and talked.  He went to bed and I called a friend. Later that night, he came in my room and did things that I didn't welcome or want.  I said no.  He ignored it.  When he left my room he said next time we would do more.  I was freaking out, shocked and scared.  Cried all night till I fell asleep. In the morning he was gone to work and I had to take my state board test.  I held it together until after the test.That night he messaged me and I told what he did.  He said I made it up, took it out of context, was making a big deal out of nothing and to top it off... Blamed me for flirty all the time and said "what did you expect."I'm telling my stories to show that it can happen to anyone, by anyone.  It was not my fault.  Flirting is not saying rape me.  I should have fought him, pressed charges, told everyone..... But I didn't.  That is my fault.  #nomeansno    #mystory
