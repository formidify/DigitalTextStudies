Thank you all for the inspiration to write. I have been writing in Norwegian media about this campaign and the Norwegian outrageously shitty politics on rape, but this is going to be brief. This is "just" my .- Peace an loveIt was not particularly dramatic nor violent. I do not have bruises. But I went blind. And I could not move. I was at a party. I was on my way home, waiting for a taxi. Moments earlyer I sat on a chair and really just felt a litle buz. But the next moment I was completely blind and laying on the floor. The first thought was just, wow, sometimes a drink goes straight to ones head. Then he picked me up. Carried me quite gently into another room. Layed down the paralyzed body on a sofa and undressed it. Completely quiet. Without any drama. Without any resistance. No bruises. No police or medical examination. Just quiet. I went home. Showerd. Sleept. And stayed quiet.
