Do you know how many times it's happened to me. I can't even count the times.  I've lost good jobs because of this. I started working when I was eight years old, in the cotton fields with my parents. I was a tiny girl and i wasn't big enough to chop cotton, but I was sure big enough to pick it. I worked with my parents, so I was safe, but my first job without them was working in a Frosty Freeze at 18 yrs old and that asshole boss, would come rub himself up on me. I'd push him away, but that didn't stop him. He did the same thing to my cousin and we didn't know about sexual harassment in 1971 or 72. We ended up quitting that job and went to work in the potato sheds in Edison part of Bakersfield, California. I've quit so many jobs in my life, cause it seemed like these men always wanted to grab my ass or try to kiss me. I'm sure that this has happened to so many women, but they didn't say anything, because they were afraid of losing their jobs, back in the day.I'd even venture to say that it's happened to men also. I say I was safe, when I worked with my parents, but going home was another story. At six yrs old I was raped by an old man that lived next door. Then when I was nine, I was raped by a 13 yr old boyThen raped when I was 16 and ended up pregnant, by a guy that lived up the street and he was 19. My mother made me marry him, he continued to rape me and after I had my son, he kept raping me and I got pregnant again. My two sons are 11 months apart. We were dirt poor and I had to endure it, but after my second son was born. The land lady called the police, because he was coming after me with a broken beer bottle and she could hear me screaming.  Yep, and they blamed it on my big brown eyes and how I looked at them. They are just FRIGGIN eyeballs.
