Reading through all yesterdays  stories this morning, I am #grateful & #Inspired by all the brave Women, and also men, who shared. These stories help educate and protect women, children, and parents.The 23 year old woman who snowed my parents and "fell in love" with me when I was 14 did not follow published statistics. Luckily, my parents brought a counselor in who began questioning after my already troubled self as I spiraled further down. Thank you mom.The tactics of a adult male skating rink employee, who turned out to be a already convicted child molester, were not textbook. And at 13, I learned to no longer get tricked into a car with the promise of speed skates...and become trapped and parked, and then not dropped off until I convinced him that "this is my home" (It was not, I walked home) And my parents would not allow the local police to 'bug' me, like they wanted. Thank you again Patricia Barutha Tovar. I was so scared.Although these people and sadly others, altered my life forever, I have found personal triumph and justice through educating my children. To those who started , thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am one man who will be passing on your stories to my babies. Sons & Daughter.Predators target the vulnerable, and education can help reduce the risk. I look into my boy's eyes, and it places such an important perspective on what to look out for, AND how to treat others.
