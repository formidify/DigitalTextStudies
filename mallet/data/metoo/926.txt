.When I was born my mom had left my bio-father for another man, my step father. After a 3 years of being together they decided to go there separate ways. My mother lost everything as she began to use drugs to numb her situation, and ended up living in a Cemetery, which meant she could no longer care for me. So she decided it would be in my best interest to go stay with my step father which had remarried to a woman who had two sons. (My bio-father didn't want me). By this time I was 4-6 years old and my step mother and father didn't have much them selves but we did have a roof over our heads and food in our tmmies and a bed to sleep in and a room I had to share with my teenage stepbrothers ... Late at night when my parents would go to bed, I could remember (we will call him Freddy) Freddy would creep to the living room in the trailer we lived in to make sure no one else was awake and proceed back to my bed to do his deeds. I can remember it like it happened last night. This went on for a couple of years, until one night my step dad had to go to the bathroom and caught him in the act. That was the night I had to leave everything and everyone behind that I knew to be shipped off to live with my grandparents. While my step brother faced no kind of punishment bc my step mother didn't want to loose her food benefits.. for years and years I blamed myself and tried self harm and a lack of trust for anyone . When I turned 20, I had a beautiful baby girl who gave me reason. I am now 26 years old, with two amazing children and a wonderful loving supportive fiance. While Freddy is serving his time in the pin for multiple sex related offenses.. Learn and Grow. But most of all forgiveness. Is the key.
