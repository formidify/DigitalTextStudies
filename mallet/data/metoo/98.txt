 I was sixteen, just started high scool. I should stay over for the weekend  with my rather new boy friend. He identified himself with a cristian cultural belief in which sex before marriage was not ok. So we didn´t do that, but kissing and hugging were ok. And it seemed obviously to be ok to sleep together. We spent a lovely afternoon walking in the countryside, and had dinner with his family. Then we went to his room, where he raped me. I protested and try to get him off me but he was stronger than me. The sudden turn from confidentiality and nearness to violent abuse paralyzed me in feelings of chok, shame, guilt and sorrow. I went into another room where i stayed until I was to be picked up the following afternoon. We never spoke again. It was strange and incriminating to be in the same everyday small circles af the high scool, where he was socializing with my friends. The paralysis turned slowly into a sort of amnesia, and I didn´t tell anybody until a psychotherapist helped me twelve years after. The rape and the fact that I kept it to myself had a deep influence on my life for very long. It made me feel lonely and outcast, and made it difficult for me to be my true self in relations with men, to feel worthy, free and confident. I wish I would have stood up for myself back then, and I hope for every other girl and woman that they will stand up for them selves and each other!
