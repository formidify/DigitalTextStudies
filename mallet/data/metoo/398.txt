I know I have a lot of stories. I just come from a redneck town and family where these things were common. Monsters in every corner and it's a wonder I'm alive. How do you get people to believe you may have been molested multiple times throughout your entire life? My life is so long and hard it's unrealistic. This isn't a third world country. This is in America. This is supposed to be frowned upon. How does a little girl grow up living this life? How did the good sane people not see it? How many people knew and did nothing? They make movies about MY life and girlfriends sit with their friends watching it eating popcorn gossiping and don't realize this stuff is REAL. It exists. I'm that girl... but you don't look at me.. you avoid me. People don't get us. They fear us. They know they've seen it and have done NOTHING.
