Does a guy sitting next to you on a public bus masterbating count as sexual harassment? And what does it mean when it happens again two weeks later, different bus route, different guy? I didn't know what to do about it. I told my family and my father laughed.I recall watching News4 New York around the same time this happened, '91 or '92, and Chuck Scarbourough was reporting about a female bus driver getting raped in her bus and he was smiling. I thought, what the fuck is so funny? And Sue Simmons was sitting next to him.Or what about if your best friend in high school is a guy that everyone loves and he threatens to kill you? I didn't know where to turn, all of our mutual friends were girls who would have taken his side.I was never raped.
