First time a man came at me sexually, I was 11 - he was a family friend in his 60s. I didn’t know about sex-just had a feeling that it was wrong when he put me on his lap, behind the barn, and tried to put his hand in my pants. I jumped off and ran. Thereafter, every time he saw me he gave me a quarter. It was “hush” money. I didn’t say anything because it was 1961 and, tho a child, I would have been blamed and I didn’t understand what was going on. Same for adolescence and adulthood. ..women are still subject to sexual harassment daily. Prior to this, when still with my family, circa 1955, I was out on the lawn with younger sister who was 3, I was 5.  A car pulled up, the passenger door opened and the man showed me a handful of candy and tried to get us into his car. Again...I did not know what it was about...all I knew is that he was DANGER. I grabbed sisters hand and ran off screaming nonstop like an alarm siren. He left...I never told anyone. I didn’t tell anyone about the time when our family doctor, during a physical to be cleared for the high school  basket ball team, placed his hand on my right breast and said “ Come back and see me when you’re brown as a berry !” (I tan dark). I was a virgin and didn’t know what sex was yet.... I didn’t tell anyone about this or a neighbours large son raping me at 16. We kept our mouths shut so we were not condemned as “sluts”. There were several more occurrences that I just left behind me for I refuse to live in fear. Seems that not much has changed. 3 months ago a drunk man at a local bus stop said ” I’m going to follow you home and fuck you stupid”. I took him out with one blow and I did not report it because I would be charged. He harassed me for 10 minutes prior to that statement- filth spilling from his ugly mouth. .. I’m 67 years of age now. Over the course of decades sexual harassment never stopped and it never will until all men are forced to be accountable....😳....like that will ever happen. I am NOT a victim and never will be. 😊
