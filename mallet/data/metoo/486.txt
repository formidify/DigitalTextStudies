The happening that developed my "don't fuck with me face and demeanor. There were number of incidents for two years before this, but this was the one that really showed I was on my own in this world. I had never feared for my life before. I was in the 6th grade and made friends with a girl named Diane. She introduced me to her cousin Vicki. Vicki's family ran a motel in town near where I lived. I spent a few weeks hanging around with Vicki. Then One day she asked me if I would like to go on a over night fishing trip on the river with her and her dad. I thought it would be great, I didn't get to do a lot of these kinds of things. [sidebar] My mom was a single mom working her but off to support two kids and she had just entered a meaningful relationship, first one in 6 years. So she never brought any jerk offs home. She and the rest of the family just had a talent for De-Nile of any topic that was messy. On with the show. I have no memory of what happened thru that day. what is stuck in my head is going down the river to the canyon. When we got to a point he liked we dropped anchor, that what he called it. This was the place we were going to sleep for the night. He put out three sleeping bags with his in the middle. I woke up with his hand over my mouth and nose. With him whispering in my right right ear "be quiet or I'l throw you over the side of the boat and hold you under". All I see is the moon above the edge of the canyon. Not sure how things went from there. I know that Vicki started calling my house with crank calls, I ended up in trouble for not being a grateful child. This is the hearest thing in my life to talk about because I have blocked so much of it. The one thing I do know is that there is a picture of me with my 6th grade class, and if you have half a brain you can tell that something was going on. I listened to no one from that point on. All adults were just as stupid as children and didn't give a fuck about anyone but themselves.
