I remember a lot, not all, but a lot, and every day I'm constantly fighting to figure out if what is in my head, was real, or a dream. Its been a long deciphering process that's for sure.. Yes I'm stronger then ever and those years of abuse seem like a very distant memory, but that's what it still is, a memory. It started when I was child, and finally stopped when I was teenager because I fought back! I remember feeling scared, but trying to tell myself this must b normal, even tho I couldn't tell mummy. It was a confusing time, where one minute I'm getting treated like a princess because we where in public eye but then behind closed doors was a completely different story!  I'd love nothing more then to go fight to put that monster away, but now I have my own family to worry about, a partner that needs a supporting missus, and a son who needs and deserves a mother who gives 110 percent, and not distracted by the tedious long process of the court system The best thing for me was to accept, and move on, and its working#8yearsofmylife#strengthcouragesurvive
