This  has got my mind going non-stop. Maybe it's because I'm obsessive. Maybe it's because I never healed. Maybe I never let go. Maybe... Maybe. Just maybe, I was a baby girl. Memories didn't even stick in my precious little head yet.I can't even tell you when it began because I was so little.  A "trusted family member" broke me and stole my innocence. He robbed me of so much. I doubt he thought much about what would happen to me. Memories of his man-sized, groping hands, hurting my tiny girl parts. Bribes to play Nintendo -- "Sit on my lap while your sister plays and if you sit nicely you can play too.""Come see all the fish downstairs.""Let's go see the Kitty's outside."Flashes of his ugly face. His stupid dark hair. His disgusting breath... Things I will never forget. Things that have caused me to wake in a cold sweat - terrified.. I felt it all. I've relived it all a million times.My attacker never had to pay for his crimes. I did. I do...., folks. .
