When I was a kid.. he touched me in such horrible ways that I can never forgive and never forget.. I still get nightmares about it. He was/is a very close relative..I wish I had the courage to speak to my parents or my sister that time about all of that. It was very difficult for me to trust any man after that for a long long time.Few years back finally I informed him that my husband knows what ever he did.. from then onwards he has avoided every confrontation with me or my husband.If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote "." as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.
