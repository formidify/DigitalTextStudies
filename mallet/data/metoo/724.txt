I was drunk and genuinely just wanted to watch a movie. He was not pleased that I said no because he had other plans for me that night. I still am triggered by a specific song that he sang and was playing, in addition to smells and sounds sometimes. I walked away with scratches and bruises on my lower back from a shelf that hung over my dorm bed, in addition to bruises on my tongue from him sucking and biting so hard in order to keep me there. I went to a counselor at my university and went through the process of reporting him because my counselor was required to report it. It was the scariest and hardest thing I've ever done, but he ended up being suspended from my university for 2 years. So many strangers knew my story because so many people were involved in the process. I shut down and dropped out of school because I no longer felt safe. My husband helped me through every step of the way, and still does when I become triggered. I feel like it's sometimes a lie when they say it becomes easier. Those bought of fear and panic and anxiety are never easy. I am thankful, though, that they are fewer between now.  #wearesurvivors #nomeansno
