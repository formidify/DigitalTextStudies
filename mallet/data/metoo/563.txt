Question: For those of you who did confide in some people about sexual abuse, rape, assault etc, did you find there was a timeframe considered "acceptable" for you to grieve or be upset?Most of my experiences are those I kept to myself, but there was one I shared. I was raped while in my final year at university, so I told the police and relevant authorities at the university, and confided in a small group of people who studied there.I found that any understanding or compassion at all (apart from by a couple of peers) dwindled after about two months. I was expected to be "back to normal" by then.
