I live in Barbados... a small Caribbean Island.. many girls...women and some men have horrific stories of sexual assault and abuse ... but being a small nation you can imagine the whispers and finger pointing that will take place if many would be so bold as to say ... I wish they would though... Sexual abuse in my nation has plagued so many that outcries and national forums on the issue have been heated in its debate...Even I took down my post from my FB page and kept my post to this forum as I dont want to answer any questions....over a period of months I wrote my lifestory out in like a novel... That helped a lot... ... one of the most profound movements towards healing I have ever seen in my life...that us women should be so bold and brave to find healing in each others pain and not victim shame or brand each other but rather see the problem where it hides... And it does hide.. while we  look at ourselves in shame and lesser than.....we fail to see one major strength... those who do harm never want to be known openly... should not be happening... but here we are over regions, religions and economic backgrounds... The mental capacity to put one foot in front the other sometimes more feel like 'I am lifting up lead with a feather' But many feathers can hold up lead..
