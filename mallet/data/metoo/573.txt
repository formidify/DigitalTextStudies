I was four years old, the first time I walked in on my parents being intimate. Confused, I later asked my "father" what he and my mom were doing. He explained that they were having sex. I asked, what's sex? He told me. Then, he asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. 😔😔😔That's where it all began, an innocent child with a complicated question. He started molesting me, two years later. Every night, after everyone went to sleep... my body would cringe every time I would hear the floorboard by my bedroom door creak. My skin would crawl as I felt him hoover over my bed, as he'd prepared himself with Vaseline and popped a porno in my VCR. Soon, an uncle that was living with us at the time decided to join in. It was like they rotated nights, one nightmare after another.This went on until i was 13 years old. I'd told family members, school officials and family friends... No one believed me, often calling me crazy and calling the crazy hospital on me. Finally,  one day... my mother asked me... I lied at first, afraid of being sent back to Bellueve. But, she asked again and I couldn't hold it in. I bared my soul... she also told me that he wasn't my biological father. He semi-confessed to our pastor and it was the pastor that called the police. He was arrested a few days later after he tried to kill me. My mother threw me out and said that God would strike me dead for lying on her husband. I was 13 and homeless. Central park benches and trains were my home.Nine months later, before I was set to testify before the grand jury.. my mother offered me my home back if I retracted my story. I did. He was released and I moved back home.He started with me the very same day he came home. This went on for another three years.. until, I got pregnant with my first son (not his child) He raped me while I was pregnant. That was the last straw. I told my mom and again i was out of a home. So, I began prostituting; to feed my son and myself. I lived this lifestyle for two years, all the while dating this young man...just a few years older than me. He found out what I was doing and moved  my son and I into his home. We married a year later. It's been a troublesome 11 years..  and although we've recently divorced I am still here! I am the mother to five and half(currently expecting) beautiful children, I am a published author,  a business owner and soon to be a college graduate.  I am not a victim, I am a survivor!!!Thank you for taking the time to read my story ❤
