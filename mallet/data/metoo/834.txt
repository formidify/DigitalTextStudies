 Once when I was 14. And many times from 16-18 by a man I married when I turned 16.... I'll spare you all my story but I know time heals. I'm 30 years old married to my best friend and am a good wife and mother. I prayed through it and became stronger because of that reason alone. I couldn't be where I am without God and his Grace
