Early seventies Bogga rd gaol Brisbane .....G wing around 80 blokes lived in three decker beds....on my third night seven or eight"G wing blackboyz" bashed n raped me after dragging me to toilet area....very primal experience.Kinda ironic considering how the rest of my life developed.Iv forgiven them, myself n even the incredibly incompetent authorities....but I'd still like to catch up with detective  Dorries.....no I think he's dead
