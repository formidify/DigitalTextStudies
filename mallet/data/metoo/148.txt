Like so many of you I too have been sexualy harrassed mainly by men who I thought were friends, teachers, men I thought I could trust. I never realised until now how common it has become and that is very sad. I thought of putting up a story but then I realised that's all it is. The pain the emotions and fear these stories create are the same no matter the story. Instead I would like you to know that you are not alone and you are all powerful women who can create great beauty.It's time for us to unite as one. We need to start supporting and protecting each other. Do not allow the stories of the past define who you are now. You can use the past to empower yourself so as to not allow it to ever happen again.  For me it was to continue living life, learning to heal my wounds and making peace with this world. Learning self defence has been a great tool for empowering myself. Over three years now and it feels good that I now know how to kick some ass if I have to. ha ha  Sadly we leave in a world where all women and children need to learn how to defend themselves. Do not get me wrong. There are some incredible men out there who do honour and respect women.  Unfortunately there are many who only project their rage and fears. That is not o.k. The excuses have to stop now. If you are reading this please know that we can not change the past, we have no control of the future. All we have is the now.  Right now you can create whatever dreams you wish to have for yourself and you do not have to allow past actions of some sad, weak, wounded little men define who you are. Do not allow the fear that rules them, rule you.Now is the time for you to shine and bring inspiration to your world. Love you long time xxP.S where there is darkness there is always light. Remember that. YOU are worthy of love.
