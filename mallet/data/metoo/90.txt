The man next door...In my case it was my next-door neighbor. When we would run into each other, he would lick his lips lasciviously or flick his tongue as if to imitate oral sex.  This was his personal  favorite.  I avoided looking at this man, let alone running into him. That is, until the day he became uncharacteristically clumsy. He exited his apartment just as I did.  Damn it.  I was about to lock the door when he suddenly lurched toward me, as if falling. He “broke” his fall by grabbing my chest, a maneuver that seemed to last an eternity. Super slow motion.  His hand lingered.  He pushed me against the wall and I tried to kick him in the nuts but I missed.  I pushed back, freeing myself to run back into my apartment which, luckily, I had not yet locked. I heard him run down the stairs.I told no one. I agonized about telling my father.  I was 15 years old.  But, I knew my father would kill him and end up doing 20 -to-life.  This would mean my mother, brother and I would be homeless. I had it all figured out.  And so, I lived there in silence, guarding my secret and desperately avoiding the man next door until I moved out on my 25th birthday.Over the years, I have fantasized about returning there, knife in hand, on the slim chance I might “run” into him all these years later and experience my own loss of balance.
