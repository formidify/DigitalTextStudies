Every time I turn on the TV new, or social media, I am so proud of the  movement and what it has done.  Victims are finding their voice, and people are finally listening and more importantly believing.  So proud to be a part of something so incredible.  I know it has helped me a lot, and I think it has helped people of all walks of life to be heard and comforted.  We will no longer be silenced.  Hugs to all my fellow Warriors.
