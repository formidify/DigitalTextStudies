You couldn't possibly think you could destroy me... of course you didn't this was never about me. This was about your pleasure, as if the value of your pleasure was far greater than my sanity. But you didn't destroy me; despite the dark shadows that fog my mind, i was always destined for greatness. --your forgiven, not for you but for myself so i can walk without shame, with my head held high, my heart intact ðŸ’•ðŸ’•   writing was one of the healthier outlets I turned to, I reread this every time I feel broken over and over again until it sinks in, until the next time the horrible memories & feelings come back.
