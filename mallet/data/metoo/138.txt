I have a question.  I don’t know what to think of what happening.  My boyfriend or I should say ex boyfriend new about my past, that I was raped, been to hell and back. At my gym where I trained some trainers started spreading lies about me, that I am easy and things like that. I changed gyms, my boyfriend still was with me but when he overheard that he drifted away from me a little, started to be colder. We were together one more year till I suspect there is another woman. Shortly after I found out he got engaged while still with me. I confronted him and her. He told me I was just a “butty call” it was just sex when he was with me. He as well as his fiancé started texting me that I am a slut, that sleeps with everyone. What should I expect. I am a trash. I never slept with anyone but him. I don’t sleep around but I feel like trash. I cry everyday, not because he left but because I don’t know anymore. I am not a slut... I need help.
