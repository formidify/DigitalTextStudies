BecUse of what happened to me , I have always assumed all men are disgusting . It will most likely remain this way til my last breath. I trust none of them around little girls. I get disgusted if they get too close, or talk a certain way ,look or stare a bit too long, or hold a little girl a certain way that may seem even the slightest bit inappropriate . I feel like I have to watch for the flags of a potential predator who’s near youngsters. As I ignored the warning signs at just age 11, my instincts told me he was behaving differently and that I should call mom and go home. But I didn’t. I hate myself for this way of thinking and feeling. It makes me feel crazy!  Molested at age 11 by a family member.13 years old I was Date rape drugged and then raped.I feel disgusting talking about it , I also feel extremely sad, angry and disappointed.i wish I could go back in time and make totally different choices so that the attacks never happened. With that said , here’s a great big ‘FUCK YOU’ , to the disgusting wastes of life/ sex offenders 🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽May you all get when you deserve ! I know you will. Ladies , be STRONG💪🏼 🌸🌷
