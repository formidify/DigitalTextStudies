 I was at a friends family party last October. It was fancy dress and I was 15 I shouldn’t have been drinking but I was an irresponsible teenager. Since this guy (Let’s call him Liam) was a family member to one of my closest friends (Let’s call him Austin) I thought I could trust him, but I thought wrong. I lay on Liam’s shoulder in the living room (small house so everyone was still around) and Austin’s mum placed a blanket over us because I said I was cold. Liam had his hand on my hip because I was lying on his fake boob as a pillow and had my legs on the couch. His fingers started circling my hip and before I knew it he was groping my ass, since I felt uncomfortable I pulled his hand away and he went back to circling his fingers around on my hip again. He did this twice more and then went up and slowly groped my left boob to the point where I felt like a fucking sex toy. When he did this, I tried to pull his hand away but he wouldn’t let go until I pulled again the third time harder. He went back to circling on my hip (at which point I was terrified because I was like why tf is a 27 year old man trying to fucking grope me), I was confused and scared and didn’t know what to do. Bearing in mind as I said this was in a room full of people including Austin, his big sister and a three year old boy and so I didn’t want to randomly get up and cause a scene plus I was shocked and panicked. Finally, Liam went from my hip and slipped his hand under my pants over my underwear and got about an inch away from touching me when my Austin’s  mother asked me where I was sleeping for the night (as I was staying there too). I said I was staying downstairs with Austin as I thought and she asked Liam where he was staying too (I didn’t know he was staying until she asked him) and he said “Oh I’ll stay down here then”. Austin said “oh well if you and dad are sleeping down here then me and Caitlin will go and sleep upstairs” and then when I told Austin he said it wasn’t a big deal and Liam probably didn’t know what he was doing. I rang my boyfriend and he was completely livid.I honestly honestly believe it would’ve gone a lot further if 1) Austin’s mum hadn’t stepped in when she did and 2) If I’d have slept downstairs.The day after I went down and Liam was acting completely normal and (this happened on a Saturday) the Thursday after he messaged me trying to have a normal conversation. I told him what he’d done and he remembered none of it and called me a liar and told me he could lose his job if a stupid little girl like me didn’t shut my mouth and quit making things up. I told my psychologist at the time and he told my family and the police and they got it all sorted for me. It honestly shook me up so much and Was probably one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me. Not many people know and it isn’t as bad as most on here but I wanted to share because it makes me feel better. Sorry it’s so long. Stay strong ladies and Gentlemen 💕
