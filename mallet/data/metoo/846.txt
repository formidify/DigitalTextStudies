I'm writing this first for my mother. She was gang raped by 3 men when she was 18. She walked home about 7 miles and was passed up and not given a ride by family members who saw her. This was back in 1965. Later on, my mother became a drug addict. I now understand that the trauma she experienced caused her to want to numb out through drugs and alcohol. Eventually, she got clean through 12 Step Recovery and went to therapy. But I can't help but think how different her life and mine would have been if she could have been helped and supported back then. I, too, have been date raped; sexually preyed on by an employer and experienced domestic violence with a partner who I finally called 911 on. I hope this movement will create a completely new understanding for the current and future generations about sexual violence. People must keep speaking out and insisting on justice.
