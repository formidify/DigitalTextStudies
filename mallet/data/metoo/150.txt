Ok, I’ve had it. After reading about all the “me too” and their stories, and as a woman knowing those stories myself as a REGULAR occurrence throughout my life... people act like these stories aren’t even true! These actresses are turning in those who are their “bread and butter”. THAT is how true it is! They know they will face stigma! That’s how true it is! They know they may never get jobs as actress’s again! That’s how true it is! Women face this shit every day! To deny it is ludicrous! We have just learned that no one believes us, no one cares, and we get made out to be the assholes for telling! Soooooo, from now on I will report to you EVERY sexual harassment, assault, or rape I encounter (and I have encountered a LOT in my lifetime)! I am now a Middle Aged woman, so I would think sexual harassment would end by now, but no it has not! I have received more than my fair share of sexual harassment, assault, and even rape when I was a younger woman, but I still experience too much of this crap! Not as much as before but way too much, so from now on, consider my reports on it, and I hope more women will start reporting every such event themselves too until the world can no longer deny!
