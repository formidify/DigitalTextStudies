Wow!!! What can I say......saying Thank you for the add seems inappropriate....We all have a story...sadly I am no exception...I live in Sydney Australia...yep this wonderful Island home...  is full of horror stories....some we learn about through media, and as an old Nurse...many that never even get reported to police or even worse, are never taken serious by Police...As women and this group allows us a platform.....We should and we mustStand up and say Enough is Enough...THIS STOPS NOW...Because if we don't...it will continue.I'm not sure if there is a World Wide Rally planned...but if there is please count me in...Happy to contribute and help organise from my corner of the world.United we stand Ladies...Together we can do this...Yes we are victims...but Victory will be ours....from # ...too...# This Stops Now.(Bless you ladies...stay strong... and lets support each other....Cheers Cat. xx)
