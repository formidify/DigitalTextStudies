"They can never take what's in your soul.They can never break what keeps you whole.When the rain comes down." cory hart- homewas just listening to some of my favorite music to get through a flashback, and thought I would share this beautiful verse with everyone.  No matter what people do to us,  we will overcome.  Because no matter what they do to us, they can't take away who we truly are.Sending hugs to everyone.
