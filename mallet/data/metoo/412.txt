My big sister 👭once told me that if we all wore a backpack 🎒 our entire life and had to walk 🚶🏼‍♀️ around our entire life with that backpack 🎒 on... and every life experience was a grain of rice 🍚 eventually that backpack 🎒 would get heavy 🏋🏼‍♀️... I look at you all and you are all carrying So much weight 🏋🏻...So let's say every person you find to talk about these experiences is a person you can give some of your rice to. Pretty soon that backpack isn't as heavy as it was and life slowly starts to get easier. I hope this brings light in to your path on your journey towards healing.
