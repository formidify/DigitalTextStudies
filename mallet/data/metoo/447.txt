Hello my name is Troy Burkett,and I'm a Coast Guard Veteran...I was sexually assaulted in 1989 by a ship mate. The VA insists that I was mentally disturbed to begin with. Asking for justice or even compensation only ends with being threatened with Jail or time in a VA mental health facility. They claim that the accused has passed away and because he served longer then I did, he would have had more rights then I can ever consider exercising.
