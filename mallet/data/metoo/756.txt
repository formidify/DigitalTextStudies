 I was 15, I was thinking he was my friend, brother than I never had.... When my mum heard the story, she said one thing to me, only one thing.... " you're a bitch" Leaving me with my pain and my shame...I was 18, he was my boyfriend.... he pushed me up the stairs and raped me saying " with everything I do for you, you owe me that" I was to weak to leave him ... I supported that 3 years... When I left him, my mother told me "you are very bad with him, you are not my daughter anymore!"
