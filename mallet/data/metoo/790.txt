He was my best friend. I told my boyfriend of the time and he said he didn't believe me. The guy that did it was our mutual friend. Asked him about it and of course he told him I was a liar. He told everyone I was a liar. "He would never hurt a fly." He didn't have to hurt me physically to hurt me. When he finally admitted doing anything to me, he said, "Yeah, but wouldn't you too?"This was one of many.
