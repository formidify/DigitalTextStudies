I never thinkt, that I may share in public... but I see how many posted their stories and I know that it is not easy. Thanks to everybody.To me happened a year ago, I was 26. We were out with friends to a drink, and it happened when I went home. Next de I went to police, but they could not do enything.  I felt that I am also to be blamed, despite that to the few people who know it said, that I was not... But I blame myself. Hovewer, I don't want to fear and don't want to change my life. I also hope he will find his destiny... not a beautyfull one...
