https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duress_in_American_lawOk, the  threads have me back on social media. And triggered. And wanting to fight back somehow.For anyone who has signed a contract/agreement that silences sexual assault--a la #weinstein--know that you may still have legal recourse and A VOICE.If you were in a situation of duress or were coerced into signing the contract (if you signed it without wanting to), you may be able to void it....and take the duct tape off your own mouth. I don't post often but for the sake of taking power away from some predators on this issue.....please....pass this info along if you think it could be useful. I'm not the right attorney for this (not my area of law), but this was literally in first year Contracts in law school. Your local lawyer's licensing board should be able to put you in touch with an expert who is willing to help.
