 I was groped by a co-worker when I was 23 years old. I was working at a salad bar. He was always hitting on me and I told him I was not interested but he never took no for an answer. One day I went to fetch salad dressing to re-stock from the walk-in fridge it was in a mall and the area was very secluded you had to walk through a long hall and then get to the fridge. When I got there he was inside I was already very uncomfortable. His skeezy smile made me cringe and I tried to ignore him and just get what I needed and leave as soon as possible. But then he started the flirting again and I ignored him and then he got angry and grabbed my you know what. And I screamed and punched him. I then managed to break loose and there was a cart in between us with big bottles of salad dressing and I kicked it over towards him and they went flying on him. Then I ran away. I told my boss as soon as I got back to the salad bar, I told him I was going to report him to mall security. The boss got angry at ME saying he didn't want "trouble" And its bad for business and they were friends so he was obviously protecting him. He told me to "slap him in the face next time". I regret not going to mall security I just quit my job shortly after.   This is only one of my stories.My heart goes out to all victims <3
