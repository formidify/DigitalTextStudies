 #yotambienharassed since 6 years old and raped until 12; assaulted by a "very close friend" at 22; harassed by a "producer" at 18 and other by a man who said he can turn me straight again at 25. One day, long time ago, walking down the street an unnowkn man touch my butt and leave laughing at me, i couldnt stand more and chase him, people thought he stole something from me and start to help me out, when we caught him he said he did nothing, police came and free him, telling me they can not charge him for that. After that i always carry a needle at the bus, cause every single morning an old man use to put his parts in my shoulder and guess what? i never saw him the following mornings, might be painful for him. My whole life had been a fight; things that i reject: YES. I couldnt give a real huge to my dad or grandpa, i missed that because i didnt talk, i thought it was all my fault, didn´t confront, i didn´t heal. Nowadays i can´t hear some lirycs or smell some stuffs cause reminds me a lot of things, still make sick but more than that I am a survivor and still standing.
