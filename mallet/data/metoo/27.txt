I am going to be alone again this year because my adoptive parents and two of my siblings and others some who abused their official position of power have tortured and abused me and ruined and stolen everything and i was homeless and raped because of them. I am trying to cheer myself up in the true spirit of christmas. I am starting over but I needed help to stop the violence starving servere serious neglect and rape and abuse first and stop them from robbing me blind.I had my first plastic christmas tree with lights and everything. Thank you for your support also for understanding not to pressure raped women to have sex I never wish any person in my life who rape or support rape. So this christmas i will enjoy cristmas dinner nice safe christmas music maybe church and nice safe chistmas movies and enjoy my own company I could do a lot worse and now I know. I wish you all the very best and may you find your own way ❤💖🎄🎇🎆 👼🎅💆
