******Anonymous post ****Well I didn't want to post on the page because my daughter has a Facebook. July 2016 I found out my husband of 10 yrs  (My daughter's stepfather since she was 1) was sexually abusing her. It had been going on for a couple years. She was 9 or 10 when it started and I had no clue. After sitting and crying and thinking of it for weeks, it finally all made sense. There was little signs and i had complety missed them. I threw him out and reported him. We are now going to trial. She just turned 13 and she has ptsd and will have to sit in front of him and tell a judge and jury what has happened to her. Can you please post anonymously. Any advice to help her get through this. I can't stand feeling so helpless when she needs me so much.
