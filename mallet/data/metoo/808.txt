outing the molesters....sometimes it helps and sometimes there are painful consequences. I never outed the neighbor who molested me for years starting at 11.I reported the cop who sexually assaulted me. It was a very long painful and psychologically damaging process. Going through the legal system re-victimized me. And was not resolved until 8 years later. This NJ cop was never put on the sex registry, and although he was a serial offender, he served very little time (4 or 5 years away from the prison population). These two incidences are the most tramatic, but there were many incidences of sexual harrassment and inappropriate touching, grabbing, etc.At least I know that I did the right thing by reporting the assault by this cop. Unfortunately, reporting doesn't guarantee that the perpetrator will be punished, that you will get any kind of closure, that Anything will happen, except your pain. It is a very hard lesson, but we still can not be silenced, because this is how change happens.
