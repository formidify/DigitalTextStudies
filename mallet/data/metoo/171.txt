NO MORE !What makes you think this is all right?You hold all the power and the mightBut what you don’t know is that I will put up a fight.I won't allow you to victimize me, it’s not okI am not giving in no matter what you say.When I say NO, that means hands off mistersI don’t stand alone, I have a million sisters.We will bring you down to face the shameAnd in the end you’re the one to blame.What you’ve done is a crimeAnd you will go to jail and do the time.Just because you’re a man, doesn’t mean I wont stand upI’ll tell the world that you are corrupt.You can’t use me as a toy for your pleasureMy body is mine and it’s a treasure.NO MORE ! We shout to the world, NO MORE !End sexual abuse now, thats what we stand for.Now is the time to change the mind setIt doesn't have to be this way.Teach your sons about kindness, equality and respectAnd we can all have a better day.
