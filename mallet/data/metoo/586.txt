My earliest encounter I can remember was when I was three or four years old. I didn't know what it was or what it meant. I didn't know that fear, harassment and assault was going to be a recurring theme throughout my life; an ongoing, heavy and constant unspoken anxiety every time I left the house. I didn't know that my peers and some family members would tell me that I deserved it, that I asked for it, that I had better learn my lesson. I didn't know that I would be called a liar, an idiot, a bitch and a slut by those who were meant to protect me. I didn't know that my school would tell me I should have screamed when it happened as a teenager. When I moved to London and it happened again, I didn't know the police were going to shrug and assume I probably wanted it. I didn't know I would be interrogated or that my father would be questioned about my sexual preferences in a separate room. I can't count all of my encounters with sexual abuse and harassment on both of my hands, but I can count those who understood and didn't judge me on one.  To my friends, acquaintances and strangers who have stepped forward with the courage to tell other survivors that they are not alone: Thank you.Thank you for being so strong and sharing something so profoundly painful and personal. You have empowered me to follow in your footsteps. I love you all. <3
