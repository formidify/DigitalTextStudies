I think that my father may have molested me when I was a baby. I have a memory of getting my diaper changed and my father sticking his finger in my vagina. My mother was there and pushed his hand away. Is it possible to retain such a memory? I was a baby. Is that rape or sexual assault? It was just the one time. In grade school and high school I found it hard to focus and didn't have the best grades.My father died in 2002 at the age of 70. My mother is in her mid 80s and I'm not about to say anything. But this memory explains a lot about what happened to me later on. Social problems, alcoholism, fear of men, chronic unemployment, fear of going back to school, ending up in mental health programs. I told my therapist recently, like three months ago and she has since dismissed me because she says I'm stable. Am I too crazy to help? Did she think I was lying? I would appreciate hearing from everyone.
