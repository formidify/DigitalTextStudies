Nobody can save you but yourself. You will be put again and again into nearly impossible situations. They will attempt again and again through subterfuge, guise, and force to make you submit, quit, or die quietly inside. Nobody can save you but yourself and it will be easy enough to fail, so very easily. But DON'T DONT DONT!!! Just watch them. Listen to them. Do you want to be like that? A faceless, mindless, heartless being? Do you want to experience death before death? Nobody can save you but yourself. AND YOUR WORTH SAVING! It's not a war easily won. But if anything is worth winning  then this is it. Think about it. Think about saving yourself, your spiritual self, your gut self, your singing magical self, and your beautiful self SAVE IT. DONT join the dead in spirit. Maintain yourself with humor and grace and finally if necessary wager your self as you struggle. Damn the odds! Damn the price! Only you can save yourself. DO IT. DO IT. Then you will know what I'm talking about. -Charles Bukowski
