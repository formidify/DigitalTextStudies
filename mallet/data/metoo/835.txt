I didn’t feel comfortable posting this on my own page so thanks for letting me share.12 Years old- bussing tables in my parents restaurant. A elderly man in a wheelchair stopped me and said “may I give you a compliment?”“You have the nicest ass I’ve ever seen”13- first day of 8th grade, boy told me “damn girl, you grew up this summer” proceeded to say other derogatory comments about my body. I punched him in the face, I was suspended, he was not. 14- was told to get out and walk the 3 miles home from where we were parked because I didn’t want to have sex with him in the back of his car.15- Lost my virginity to a guy I barley knew because he was older and I felt pressure from my peers because I hadn’t lost it yet. 15- after weeks of convincing I sent my boyfriend “nudes” he showed them to every person he knows, it was years before I stopped hearing about it.15- I begun a romantic relationship with someone 12 years older than me. It took me many years to realize he was a predator.17- After a night of drinking I was blackout drunk. I woke up the next morning with a man I thought was a friend but who I had never expressed in any interest in. I asked him what happened and he said “well you didn’t stop me”
