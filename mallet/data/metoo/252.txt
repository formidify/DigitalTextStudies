Morning from the Uk to all members!!!I wanted to ask you about how we can now show the group to the world.This groups main aim is to put all our stories and hashtags on one place so we could illustrate to the wider global community the vast scale of the issue.As posts start to slow down and itâ€™s not quite so crazy on here, I wonder should we think about guiding the world to our group.Sharing and asking others to share is one thing, but find press and media outlets is a great way to get the word out there especially as this is a â€˜hot topicâ€™.Iâ€™m looking for your ideas?Can you help? Itâ€™s your group...Do we need to change the name of the group so it invites everyone to take a look maybe? Talk to me!  ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
