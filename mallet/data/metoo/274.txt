I've been struggling if I should write this post.  I've realized I need to get my story out.  Maybe someone went through something similiar.  So here I go.I was 17 years old and working a great job at a local museum.   It was 3 people working everyday there ( The director, a retired handyman, and myself).  It was a small group.  It was a normal day, and I was doing some work at this big table.  The Director was away on business, so I was working on an upcoming event.  While I was working, the other employee came into the kitchen.  We chatted like normal nothing different.  He came over to where I was sitting and looked over my shoulder.  I thought he was looking at something I was working on.  Next thing I know, his hand was touching my left breast.  I just froze.  What do you do?  I could have said no, but it wouldn't come out of my mouth.  He just left afterwards.  I think I just tried to shake it off and keep working, but these thoughts of what happened and what do I do came in.  I began to worry about my job.  I loved working there.  Would the director believe me over him?  So I said nothing to no one.  What people don't understand is this just doesn't go away.  I put up a bigger wall then I already had.  I only let people get so close, then that's it.  I even kept my husband at a distance.  I struggled for years being around older men.  Now that I'm 38 and going through therpy, I'm getting better.  It's a struggle everyday just to be "normal".  A part of me knows people won't ask what happened, but I want them to ask.  I want them to know it happens and it can happen to anyone.
