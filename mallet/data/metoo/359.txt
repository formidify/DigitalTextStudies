Laying in bed reading about all these  stories and I realize I buried alot of shit inside me. I know why I am the way I am. Why I never wanted to have a daughter. Why I never trusted anyone. Why I will never leave my kids with anyone. Honestly I don't care if anyone dislikes me because I guard my kids with my life...that's my job!! I don't trust men in fact the only person I trust is my husband & my kids. The only disagreement I have with my husband is why I don't let folks get close to my kids. Until it has happened to you...you will never fully understand. Yeah maybe not everyone is like that, but why would I even chance it. I'm not ashamed to tell my story because unlike most women as a child I had the courage to fight back for myself & my little sister. But that's not everyone's story... But please tell me again why I should trust anyone nowadays especially now that I have a daughter.I'll be damned if anyone harms her or my boys!! #survivor
