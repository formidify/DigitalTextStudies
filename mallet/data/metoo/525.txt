this is an open group. someone on here was making me feel uncomfortable. I had to block him. It took me a while to figure out how to do that. In case anyone has the experience, you can click on the person's name which takes you to their profile page. next to the link "Message" there is an elipsis (...) click on the three dots and you get the option to block the person. You will no longer see their posts on any page and they will no longer see you.
