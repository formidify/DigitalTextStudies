So it's been about a week or so since  came alive, it took me awhile to to think if I was going to add to the insurmountable numbers of women and men that bravely bared all for the world to see. I was ashamed. I felt that me writing  wouldn't mean anything to anyone. I figured who cares? I felt like its no ones business. But after contemplating it I have decided to add to the list of many women and men out there that thought of themselves for a moment, to relive that moment in their lives and be open and vulnerable to the world. But doing that empowers us to see that we're not alone. That doesn't mean that we minimize what has happened to ourselves but comfort us to feel open with others to talk about it.
