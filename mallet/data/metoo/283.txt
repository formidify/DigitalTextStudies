Dont forget the Men in . Statistically 1 in 6 boys will be sexually assaulted by the time they are 18. That equates to about 21,000,000 male survivors in the US alone.  Think about your father, grandfather, husband, boyfriend, son, nephew, uncle, a co-worker, the guy who gets you coffee....we are survivors as well.  As we have open and honest discussions with the  women in our lives about rape and sexual assault, we should also be having open and honest discussion with the men in our lives.    I am a survivor and founder of the Power of 21, a non-profit uniting the 21,000,000 male survivors into a powerful force for change.  Talk to the men in your lives. Resources are available to help them.
