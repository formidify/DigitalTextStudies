Ya know, I may not be able to prove the rape attack but I can prove PTSD as a result of the attack and I can prove being awarded Soc Sec Dissability Insurance (SSDI), as a result of the attack. So, seeing they are extending the statute of limitation on sexual adsault, I was thinking of filing a criminal report in ogunquit, ME. At the time, my lawyer employedy a different strategy in the civil lawsuit (or else I suppose he may have been bought). I'm gonna start there anyway. I have no one, no emotional support at all. This happened in 2002.
