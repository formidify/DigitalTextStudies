I am not a victim of any sexual harassment, but reading those stories, Damn we live in a really fucked up society. The society is unsafe for both men and women. I really hate Twitter users where they marginalize men. Both men and women will have the same trauma if they were a victim. Marginalizing a gender is going against the cause of what this is about; I strongly believe we should listen to everyone's story and help them in ways that are possible. Stay Strong. Respect your bravery!
