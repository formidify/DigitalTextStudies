K was raped when I was 16, my sister thought she would have a friend of hers do this. She felt that since I was more interested in sports and my friends, that she had the right to have her husbands friend violate me. I told my first boyfriend what happened. He thought it was crappy that she laughed about it in front of him. To this day(30+ years later) her and I do not have a relationship. I have been told I deserved it and it was my fault. I have tried to tell her it was a shitty thing to do. She says that I need to get over it. All I know is when I was raped I lost all sense of security. I controlled, everything in my life to where I became bulimic, withdrawn and still haven't had any relationship with anyone. It wasn't till I meet my ex husband and seizures due to being bulimic that I truly got therapy. But, I fall back into habits of withdrawal. I am still working on all of this. But..I have a friend that I knew from 13, she has never hurt me in anyway. She is my sister..and best friend
