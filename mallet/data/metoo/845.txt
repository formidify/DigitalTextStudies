The first time was a guy I was datings older brother. I was 16 and he was in his late 20s. My bf didn't believe me and I never told anyone else bc if my own bf didn't believe it why would anyone else I thought...Fast forward to my early 20s...I was in a bad place in my life and was drinking way too much. A guy I met and had just started to see regularly took me home bc I couldn't drive and it happened again. He was too strong for me to get him off of me and he really hurt me. He threatened to kill me if I ever told anyone. I was terrified and naive so I never told anyone. I also didn't think anyone would ever believe me, so I kept it in all these years. I'm 33 now and still have nightmares about it.These still haunt me to this day... And this is the first time I've ever really talked about it. I'm still scared no one would believe me
