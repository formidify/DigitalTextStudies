15 year Army Veteran.  After over 30 years of burying so deep I never ever discussed with anyone, I finally started dealing with my Military Sexual Assault.  Bringing it out to the open has caused PTSD, Acute Depressive disorder, and more.I am a rape survivor.  I refuse to be it's victim any longer. I will not let it own me anymore.  I'm taking my life back at 56.  It held me captive for decades without even knowing it.It will not make decisions for me anymore.
