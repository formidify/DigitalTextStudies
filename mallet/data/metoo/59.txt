I was verbally and emotionally abused by an employer (doctor) which was totally unfounded and inappropriate - it has caused much pain for me - and at the time, a 'job' was critical to my survival as a parent - I still shake my head at the behaviour and even went to a lawyer, but quickly realized that it would be a David and Goliath issue.  I am sure that had I been a man, the issue would have been handled differently.
