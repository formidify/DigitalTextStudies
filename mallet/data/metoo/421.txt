To all those feeling the impact of the  we wanted to offer a simple, soothing and supportive self-love practice to you.  This is inspired by a comment from one of our Radiant Sensuality group, Bayari Lou Beegan which I read this morning and burst into tears, feeling the impact of her words on the collective consciousness:“Aloha beauties,Well the heart / breast exercise couldn't have come at a better time, I feel. With all the fallout from  and lots moving through, I really sunk into this holding with lots of sighs and a few tearsAgain, I was in the bath - by candelight - so could really take time to hold myself and say soothing words tooBig love to you all,B xx”The synchronicity of life is extraordinary, we planned this programme months ago, and this practice got scheduled on the perfect day for it.So if it can help anyone handle their pain, Katrine Berling Christensen and I wanted to offer it to you. Please share with anyone who needs it. This is dedicated to all the wonderful women we know and all those we don’t, who have bravely chosen to share their sexual abuse stories, we hope that you find healing in speaking out and healing in being heard.Juiziehttps://www.facebook.com/jenni.smallshaw/videos/10155956760461155/
