It's disturbing to me that a man can be the victim of sexual assault and sexual harassment from a woman, and the man will get laughed at when he shows up trying to file a Police Report....some people will say that he is making it up....others will accuse the man of distorting the truth of what really happened...while still others will just back away because it is too much information for them to take in and handle. I am a survivor and I just keep on keeping on....
