. The first time: grade school. 1970s. Another female student would corner me in the girls' restroom and threaten to beat me up if I didn't do what she wanted - and what she wanted was xxx rated. The second time: my stepfather. Mid to late 1980s. When he drank, and it was a lot, he couldn't keep his paws off me, he crawled into bed with me and tried to feel me up, he tried to stick his tongue down my throat, etc. I moved out of there in 1991 and never went back. Because of this, I never saw my mother again for the rest of her life. She died in 2012.
