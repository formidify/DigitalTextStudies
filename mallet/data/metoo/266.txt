Yesterday I posted a  to give another voice of support to this issue.  First thing this morning, I deleted my post from yesterday.   My thought was that for me, this issue was"water over the dam", over 40 years ago, something I never mentioned to anyone or did anything about.  That's exactly the issue, just keeping quiet.  A short time later, I figured out it wasn't " water over the dam" after all.  It was more like I "let the sleeping dog lie." It's been asleep for over 40 years and you know what sometimes happens when you wake up a sleeping dog?  It bites!  So, now I find myself stepping up to giving voice to this cause.  Yes, speak up.
