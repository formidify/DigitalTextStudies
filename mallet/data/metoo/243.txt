I want to confront my molester but idk if I should. So I'll just post here what I want to say. You ruined me. You know you ruined me. You broke me down into little pieces and stomped on them. You know what you did. I don't have to explain it to you. And to tell my little brother that it was something that I've done? I was the one that did the "terrible" thing? I hope that when he gets older and he is old enough to understand what happened, I hope he hates you. I hope he never sees your face again after he finds out what happened. After he finds out what kind of disgusting person that you are. But you know what I want to say thank you. You were the best thing that had ever happened to me. I wouldn't be who I am today without the pain you put me through. It took me hating myself, wanting to die, and wanting to scrub off every inch of my body to realize it, but I realized how strong of a person I am. If it weren't for you, I would be a different person. Don't get me wrong, I still hate you, and I wish you nothing but the absolute worst. This isnâ€™t an open invitation for you to write, call, or contact me in any way, but this is for me to show you how great my life has been without you in it. Even though I went through hell trying to get over what you did, my life is so much better without you in my life. Without love, Your victim
