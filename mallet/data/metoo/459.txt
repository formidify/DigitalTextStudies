Hi people, I write for Scholieren.com, the biggest website for high school students in The Netherlands and Belgium. I want to write a blog about the stories behind  , but in my own social media I could just find one person. That's why I try in this group, because I think these stories need to be told to high school students. I am looking for someone in the age range 13 till 20, your name can be changed on my blog if you want and I'll only use your story for my blog.
