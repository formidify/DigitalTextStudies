I wrote this song half a year ago and I want to share the lyrics with you,  in a way hoping that this description makes sense to you and that you can relate to it in one way or another or hopefully even better feel some comfort in it, especially in the last part, breaking through the walls of feeling guilty and ashamed !.....Hopefully I will be able to make a music video of it next year. In fact in these days I am gathering people I know to help me out as actors and dancers to illustrate the lyrics and I am also looking for a person running a music studio who want's to record my song for free for a good purpose.Let there be hope let there be lightI’m sitting here, crying and shaking on my ownI’m freezing inside my soul, feeling so alonemy room is dark and my heart is crushed in twoI wonder is there anyone out there whoWill believe in my story and listen to my painright now I feel I have so much more to gainto keep my painful secret deep insideto pretend I’m quite ok I have to hideRefr.But let there be hope, let there be lightplease support me in my fightlet me be strong, and let the songabout future be so brightplease hold me a while when I fallremind me of my dignity so I can stand tallI’m sitting here, feeling so guilty and ashamedI’m wondering will my life ever be the sameI’m struggling to find something that makes me gladmy energy is low and I feel sadRefr.But let there be hope, let there be lightplease support me in my fightlet me be strong,and let the songabout future be so brightplease hold me a while when I fallremind me of my dignity so I can stand tallThe years have past and now I feel so strong and freeI have accepted the story will be a part of meBut now I can cope with days that lays aheadMy despair is gone cause now I think insteadRefr.There is a hope, and there is lightyou supported me in my fightnow I am strong , and my own songabout future is so bright now I know even if I fallI will remind me of my dignity and once again I will  stand stall Børge Ravndal, 25.3.17(This song is not based on my own experiences, but it is entirely based on my meetings with people who have been suffering sexual abuse, telling me their horrible stories in therapy. )
