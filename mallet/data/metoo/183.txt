 3 times in my 19 years. Until the most recen I didn’t not understand that what had happened when I was younger was rape. I am only now understanding why I was the way I was growing up. & I’m struggling because my doctor see me as a child, and i don’t get the help I need. #reclaimhope #1in4girls #moreawareness
