It doesnt just happen to women. It happened to . It breaks my heart. How many men are not speaking up? So for them I will be their voice. MEN will NOT be silenced by toxic masculinity and gender norms/expectations! Men can be raped by anyone at any age and deserve love and justice the same as women! From the day I was born until now I have experienced a lot of pain and suffering at the hands of people for various reasons or sometimes for no reason at all. Neglect, abuse, physical, mental, emotional, sexual, and more, by people who I thought loved me but over time showed they did not. Family, parents, friends, strangers have all contributed in my suffering. They made me believe it was normal and that I could forget it happening and pretend it never existed, BUT I COULD NEVER FORGET. And I NEVER will. I wasn't allowed to speak up, to feel, to cry or show any emotion. For years I hid it until I finally broke down to my guidance counselor at school. I told the detectives but they called me a liar. I never got justice for any of the many abusers and pedofiles I met. They may have gotten away with their evil crimes, but they will get what's coming to them. By speaking up and REFUSING to be silent, REFUSING to forget, we can bring them down. Every single one of them. #SpeakUp AND LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD! I AM TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT CHILDREN BEING ROBBED OF THEIR INNOCENCE BY EVIL SONS OF BITCHES!! #ForTheChildren. We do not need to carry on the cycle, we need to DESTROY it and anyone trying to continue it. #NOMORE ABUSE for ANYONE!!
