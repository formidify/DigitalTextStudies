I wonder with the  activism how some of us as creatives fit into all this? Writers, poets, filmmakers, musicians? For example, we cannot write stories, films that ignore the issue but how do we raise it properly in our creative work so it isn't glorified or seen as simply sensationalising it . Got to think this through.
