I just have to say that I am very glad I found this group and I am proud of all of US for being able to discuss our attacks out in the open in this public group. Those in the closed group, I support you all as well, and hopefully someday you will be ready to speak it publicly. People need to raise awareness and support each other and I didn't even realize how much I still need to talk about this until I found this group. Didn't realize how much I never said over the 18 years since my attack. Thank you all for your support and courage.
