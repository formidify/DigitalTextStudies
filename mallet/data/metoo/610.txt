From  to #menever How do we get there? Individual behaviour change by men is essential but not enough. It needs concerted work at a societal level. Don't label it gender! Women's organisations regard this as their territory and its funding and leadership. Let's escape that mistake. Violence against women and children is a men's issue and it needs male leadership and work! When I wanted to do work on responsible fatherhood funders and gender/women's organisations would simply not spend money on work with men. It's still the same today.
