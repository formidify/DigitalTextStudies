I’m not going to get too personal. I’m glad this issue is catching traction. I think the biggest part for equality needs to be EVERYONE saying something. There are male survivors too. In the work place, we are all accountable for saying something. Sexual harassment is too normalized. I was the first to report a ceo where I worked. I had to leave bc I was just the front desk coordinator and haven’t found a job since. I know I wasn’t the only one harassed but I was the only one who said something. Sometimes not everyone has that courage, you should be the change. As nyc MTA says “if you see something, say something.” This has gone on far too long.
