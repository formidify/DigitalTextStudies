To all you kind people here, sisters, brothers - Posting '' is as far as I am willing to go on a social platform that monitors our likeliness to react here and reveal the details of the impact abuse/ assault/ rape/ harassment has had on our lives, thus collecting more data. All I can say is that it has - among other - shaped me into someone who is whole/ balanced today and does not focus on the pain these experiences may have caused; they are not directing my life, yet may have influenced the level of my resistance; I guess they made me stronger, more determined: Whenever I witness such things happening, I interfere or speak up, and I hope to be able to keep doing that. It remains difficult though, a conscious effort. Having seen so many of you courageously coming forward today, made me aware that I must at least give away: I am one of you. But I do not believe the concept of power and forced upon submission, the idea of superiority and inferiority can be abolished and disappear; it seems an inherent trade of human ways to think and act along those patterns, be it between the sexes, be it between nations when fuelling war or the way humans treat animals (and easily degrade a woman, a child, anyone perceived as an opponent or just as 'in the way' to the rank of animals). Sexual abuse goes much deeper than we can fathom at first sight. - This is why I wish all of you a healing, prosperous life, peace of mind and the ability to defend yourselves and others wherever necessary, then move on, not look back at old pain for too long. - Love - Nic
