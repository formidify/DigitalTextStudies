When I was in my early 20s I was almost kidnapped while I was walking to my bfs house. They had told me that I was further away then i was and tried to get me into their van I walked away and as I was leaving they called after me. "You're a smart girl, lucky you didn't go with us"Then about 7 years ago I was raped and beaten  so bad by a man that I had known for 16 yrs. I remember coming too and he was eating me out laughing telling me that I will have a black eye bc he had already hit me 7 times then hit me 2 more. The Doctors at the hospital were shocked that I was alive and didn't have brain damage. I went through the court proceedings and at the trial the D.A made a deal with him and he got a year probation. B.c when I called in the assault I was in so much shock from seeing how badly bruised my face was I didn't mention that I was raped until the ambulance showed up. Now he said living a good life. And I live in fear of him finding me.
