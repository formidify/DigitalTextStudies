My moms ex husband. For several years he raped me, age 13-16. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone. Anytime I asked to stay with a friend or  want something from the store, he would always say, "what do I get out of it?" ðŸ˜¢And when I did have the opportunity to tell my mom, she didnt believe me. Told me I was lying and just trying to ruin her marriage. Well, when I started locking my door at night, avoided being alone with this man, he then moved on to my younger sister. Few years ago, he left my mom. My sister and I went to the police when our mom begged us not to. Waited 3 years for a court date, and finally last year this man was sentenced to prison for only 14 years. Everyday I struggle with the depression. People tell me this will go away, but it wont.
