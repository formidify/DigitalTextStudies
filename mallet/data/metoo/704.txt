 I was raped by a total stranger at the age of 14 in 1974/75, a virgin,  he was in the military and we were living in Ft Bragg NC. It happened twice, as I believe he came back the second time, a month later, for my sister. He was from Lebanon, married with children. He was attempting to rape little girls younger than me for months before he was finally caught. I helped put him in Leavenworth Prison for 37 years. This heinous act changed me forever. I can tell my story 45 years later as if it happened yesterday. The difference today though, I have no shame about sharing my story and I have always known it was not my fault...ðŸ˜¢
