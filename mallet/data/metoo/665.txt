 I have shared my story many times and will continue to share as long as I am able to speak, to make a long story short my abuse started at the age of 5 by sitting on a family member lap when my mother would leave the home. This person molested me and threatened me not to say a word, as time went on I was sexually assaulted by 6 different individuals, but I’m truly blessed to be alive. I’ve had nightmares for years, attempted suicide twice when I was younger, fell into deep depression, anxiety, panic attack etc due to my problem past. I was lost, I felt dirty, ashamed, rejected, unloved and unwanted. I shared one time at 16 years old, but I felt no one believed me so I shutdown and remained silent for 20 years. I still remember the day I fell on my knees and cried out to God, He heard my cry. A few years later I started praying for those who abused me, yes it took a while but I wanted to forgive them so I can move on with my life, it was then when I begin to heal. I am in a better place now and I’m very grateful, I won’t lie though, I do struggle with post traumatic stress syndrome but God get me through daily. I hope my story will encourage/inspire someone to keep moving forward, I personally want you to know that there is life after trauma.
