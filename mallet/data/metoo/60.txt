Ok! So I feal somewhat healed! No more nightmares, no more panic attacks, no more enemies, no more terrors! The memories will never leave me!Nothing there will ever change! So I must! I have fled across Europe. Landed softly in Greece! Here I found something that best resembles heaven!? A functioning family! A Mon and a Dad, that cares and share love...I have not had that of feeling  ever before...!The life I  had was a life where the only times I was noticed, was against my will! But it was the same feeling of absolute disrespect of anything I had to say at home with the ones I asked for help, and never got. I was all alone! My shadow was the only one that gave me company!All this I need to lie in the past to rest! 66And few are so fortunate to be with a man like mine!He agreed that the past was consuming and hurt me! So he ran with! With my dear husband and my new fa.mily I feel free to stand up for myself! I can avoid future panic attacks, simply by staying the hell away from the ones that hurt me the most! My biological family! I haven't lost a family! They lost their daughter. A strong, smart and funny girl, who deserves protection and care!The rapists cannot affect me anymore! Too many and too blurry! I can not be forked to go through it all. That would take too much of my time, time that I would much rather spend in my present! Am I healed?
