When I would walk around the neighborhood at 12, grown men would try and hit on me.When sitting on the bus as an 7th grader an 8th grader decided it was ok to slide his hand under my ass. Reporter him to the school and he only had to miss a few days on the bus. He came back on AND BLAMED ME for reporting him.When invited over to hang out at 18 and he started to feel me up, and got upset that it didn't turn into sex.  When I would get hit on in the window at work and didn't respond to it and got called a stuck up bitch.Getting unsolicited phone calls at work asking for my number.
