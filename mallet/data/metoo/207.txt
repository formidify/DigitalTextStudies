Nine year of being sexually abused by my then husband... rape is rape.  I now work helping other women leave violent and abusive relationships.... years of counselling have helped but some days I feel my soul cries for what was done to my body.   For years I blamed myself - I don't do that anymore I give that responsibility back to the abuser.... no means no.
