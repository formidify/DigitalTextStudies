I always thought since I'm a big girl no one would ever try anything on me. My first sexual experience he rolled over and said "I always wanted to know what a fat girl was like........My  story happened 2 year ago. An elder at the church I went to....who called himself "dad" to me because my parents hate me. He was funny and made me laugh. He was a super good listener and when he saw me, he always hugged me and asked me how I was doing. We talked a lot about all kinds of things. He would always pray for me. I felt safe... One day when my family was away he asked me to go for ride with him to get lunch. I asked him where his wife was when he picked me up and he said busy. Didn't think anything of it. We went through the drive to the middle of no where. As we were driving he put his hand on my leg and rubbed it....which was weird. Still didn't see what was coming.....We had lunch in a graveyard (I love graveyards) ...in a remote graveyard. Not a person around.... then..... he put his hands down my shirt and tried to get on top of me.  I screamed and yelled until her stopped.... I was lucky and he did stop... Stopped going to church after that. I don't see him anymore but it sure makes me mad....
