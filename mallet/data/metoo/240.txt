Thanks for adding me to the group and allowing me to share. I was 8yrs old - Sexually Molested for 8 months by a grown man who was/is my cousin. I will NEVER forget it. He touched me in ways and places no man should EVER touch a child. I was shown some of the most file things in magazines. I was so confused and hurt....but didn't understand why. When I finally told and said something, my Grandmother begged my Mom NOT to report him because it would 'shame the family'. I went through YEARS as a pre teen and teen not understanding what happened, or knowing that getting my cousin 'in trouble' was not my fault. I carried that for years even into my first marriage. When I found out that I was pregnant with my first daughter, I because so afraid and depressed, because what if someone hurt her like he hurt me. Finally I got the therapy that was LONG overdue and am every day becoming completely healed. Sexual assaults whether against a woman or a man in ANY fashion hurts, is damaging, eventually (hopefully heals), but is NEVER FORGOTTEN!!! It is a life altering crime and the criminal should and must be held accountable!!!
