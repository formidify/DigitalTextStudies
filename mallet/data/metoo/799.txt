Thank you for approving me. The first time for me, it was my stepdad. I was around two when it started.  He would lock my brothers outside and tell me i had to nap. Once he hurt me so bad i tried to push away from him. He whipped me and told my mother i peed in my panties. Another time he made me take a bath with some bugs in the tub. I cried and passed out. My family thought i jad an epileptic seizure. My family took me to the doctor said i just had sand burns. There did come a time when i was sent out of town and when i came home he wasn't there anymore. I was fourteen when i was raped by a friend. Of a boy i was seeing. My first husband had to beat up on me and forced me to have sex with him. His abuse lasted for 2 years. I finally broke out of all of this and started to like myself at forty. I turn 65 in February. The idea when i was little is not to talk about it. I tried to kill myself when i was 15, because I didn't know how to handle it or talk about it. Thank you for letting us share this. I hope that this will help more people to talk about it and understand that they are victims.#me too.
