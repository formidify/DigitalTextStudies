The first time it happened to me I was around 9 . Felt like everyone that looked at me could tell that I had been touched. I just knew they saw that I was dirty.It affects my marriage daily, even after being married for 25 yrs. DH is super supportive though. And he seems to understand.More recently a man was harassing me and I didn't know how to make him stop. I suppose I let him think it was ok. I am unsure of myself when I get in those situations...it's like I am 9 years old again. ðŸ’”
