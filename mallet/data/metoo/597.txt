I see everyone sharing their stories and all of you are so brave and beautiful! ❤️ My story: started when I was 6 years old and stopped when I was 13. I got away and had to move back in with my step dad again when I was 17 and he tried to moleste me again. And so I left and told my family which resulted in me getting kicked out. Proud to say that I made it. I finally decided to tell authorities and now I've been battling the case now for almost 4 years now. But hopefully the court date will go through and I can finally move on.  If you are feeling down in the dumps just know the grass is greener on the other side. Stay positive. You are all loved ❤️
