I was in the first grade I think. He was a friend of my parents... a god father to my brother. They made me stay at his house that weekend. I did not want to. They made me drive over to his new house and check to see if all was right. I knew when we pulled into the stone drive as the car stopped and he turned to me and said I was going to be his girl today..,, that something bad was going to happen. The way he laughed... the cigars..,,the basement with the black and white tiles on the floor and of course the pool table. Feeling him behind me.... pushing and grinding..,,,,, don’t tell..,, he was a deputy sheriff....When I finally told my dad did not believe.... he invited him to the wedding and again I was trapped as we were on the bridal dance.... couldn’t anyone see what he was doing.., pulling me close in to him and rubbing the front of my dress...,, my god the nerve of that man.....
