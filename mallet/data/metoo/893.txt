Back in July, I stopped at my local gas station, like i always do. Tori, a tattoo artist down in that area, was behind the counter like always. I talked to him about touching up my tattoo, ot was 4 years old and the colors were starting to fade.At that point, he took me in the back. I was standing where they kept mops and mop buckets, but i was next to a stack of Pepsi and Mountain Dew Cases. He lifted up my shirt and started examining my tattoo thats on my ribs. Next thing i know, a 6ft tall 300 lb man has taken off my bra and won't let go of me. I started crying, he finally stopped only to expose himself and ask if I wanted to do him a favor.I called the police, its been 3 months exactly and he still hasn't been arrested.His girlfriend has gone on social media groups and bashed me, along with all of his friends. They say I made it all up because I didn't like the price he quoted me to fix it.I'll never be able to get the feeling of his hands off my chest, no matter how hard I scrub.
