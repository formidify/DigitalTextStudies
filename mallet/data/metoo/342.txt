. Sadly.  Never mind the workplace harassment.  In my preteens, I was assaulted by a family "friend," and during my 20's to age 55, three - three personal physicians came on to me; one asked "Do you fool around?" knowing I was happily married.  If you cannot trust your doctor, who can you trust?  I am so happy that women everywhere feel as if they can tell their stories now and THEY WILL BE BELIEVED!
