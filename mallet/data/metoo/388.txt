Today I realized i should share some of my history for me to get better. This is a truth history. I got throught to a lot of thing. I was born with disabiliy learners, but  people in my country in Haiti never understood i needed time for every things. When I was in Junior high my teacher always beat me to memorized math and history. They never undersood I was different from another student so i needed more times. Then, people never let me to do my stuff by my own for me to express myself. Every timr whn I made mstake they were beat me and called me stupid, bu i stayed quiet never talked. I nevr leaned how to said "no". I kept every thing for myself. They always told me i won't be nothing. When i was 6 and 7 years old, i tried to sing in my church. I couldn't know how to sing so every one where laughing at me and called me stupid. My voice was soft, i was really slow in evrythng. They always told me any men will not lovd me and i will not never have a good job and house.They played bad games with me and hurt my feeling. I still stayed silent no talked. I began to have a huge depression and taumatized when i was13 years old, but i still nevr talked. I was tryied to kill myself every time, but those fake medication never worked. I always felt someone invsible followed me, becase of that my body and my mind stayed stucked means it was not flexible. It toke me 1 hours to watch 3 dishes cause i had depression and really slow.  i was died mentaly. I never know any idea how i can survived until today. Today im in Canada im try to get some supports from psychology, hopefully one day i will cry hapiness cause I still don't feel anything. I don't have any emotion. Today, im try to talk more, im still don't trust people. I always stay lonely.i always think people and God don't need me. I should go. I keep going to live cause i have hope.
