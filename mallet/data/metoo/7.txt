“I realized that Your very best friend, the one who will always tell you the honest truth (if you are willing to see it) for good or bad, is your mirror.      Even through puffy eyes, and low self esteem, the mirror doesn't lie, it will tell you what you really need to change, wether your attitude, your weaknesses etc. but it will also show you, your beauty and your strength.       I finally took a long hard look in the mirror and I saw past the tears and I saw a beautiful, strong, intelligent woman, I saw a woman who had allowed herself to lie and cheat and be broken by the men in her life.        I decided I couldn't listen to what the people around me were saying, I had to finally see the whole truth. And I decided to use that beauty,that strength, and my intelligence to make some changes to the broken and bad pieces of me. I was willing to see my whole truth. Good and bad. And make changes to get free.” ~Domestic Violence Survivor (and sexual assault)  #Strong #Truth #Mirrors #EndStigma
