    I was telling the truth all along and no one cared so age 40 I told my mother I imagined it, must of been a bad nightmare I said that so she would one day die in peace, then I realized my mother who disowned me for her husband , she knows what happened to her little girl, she knows! I published a book of family dysfunction fiction "A Birth Imagined" that is how I started to heal but the wounds never go away.
