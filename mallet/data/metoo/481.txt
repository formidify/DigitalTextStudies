#meetoo I was stood in a busy London Station looking at the departures board at 2pm when a dirty old tramp came up behind and put his hand up my skirt, followed by a hard slap, as I turned around he came up for a boob grab. Not one person in that station intervene or asked if I was OK.  Lucky for me he was caught by British Transport Police straight away and got 6 months inside and 7 years on the sex offenders register. Sad thing is that most of that sentence came from repeatedly failing to show up at court and not the offence itself
