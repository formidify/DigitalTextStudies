A while ago something really came home to me... how much abuse strips you of your sense of ME.. the invasiveness of someone else's sexual will on you when you do not want it.. are not ready.. not interested.. how that takes a hold of your person and implants that invaders process into your being..that is not a feeling that goes away because someone wants you to keep it quiet, not say anything or hide it .. you just cannot close your eyes and say ok ... Sexual invasion is one of the most damaging of abuses us women can endure.. some of us never recover and even when you are strong enough to lift up and stand up .. the invasiveness becomes part of your story.. even if you never share it . it is still a part of your story because you cannot hide from yourself..You walk but you wonder if others can see.... you try to find new ways to bring completion to your being... you look in the mirror and wonder 'am i good enough..always measuring yourself against some yarstick of personal growth that you tell yourself you ought to be at.. For some we look at others and measure cloths. and other material possessions as a benchmark of 'perhaps if i did what they did I would be further' .. then there is the sense that you are just moving through time but not really progressing...Sexual invasion of your spiritual being robs you of your true spiritual self...your true spirit being.. its will cements itself into your heart and gut... It took me a long time understand the true intent of such invasivness.. its not that I am weak or something it wrong with me or perhaps i did this or that correct it wont come after me.. the true intent of sexual invasion is to rob your spirit of will and purpose, to bring you into subjection of someone else sense... that robbed me of so much that I just cannot hold back anymore... I hope that someone understand what I said..
