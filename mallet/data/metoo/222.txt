My story seems so tame in comparison to others on this site. When I was in my young 20’s, I worked for a family company. The grandson was the President of the company. He thought it was funny to sneak up behind me while I was filing and rub himself on my back. Nothing more, but he just creeped me out. Before too long, his grandmother fired me for “not fitting in.”Best firing I ever got! I danced all the way home.
