When I was three my dad started to molest me.. this went on until I was 15. It went from touching me, to raping me, to prostitution. My father sold me to get his drugs. He mental, physically and emotionally abused me. When I was 15 I had a miscarriage with his baby! I finally told my mom and everyone around me! And had so much support! We put him through court. But he only got 9 months in prison. I went through 12 years of abuse!! And he got nothing for it. But I have grown so strong from this! I wouldn’t be who I am today! I share my story so other know that there not alone! Because I know that feeling. I went to two mental hospitals. Lots of counseling, and support groups! I am 19 and I feel so amazing today. It’s a struggle but when you look towards the future and not the past, you CAN get through it! Your not alone!!!
