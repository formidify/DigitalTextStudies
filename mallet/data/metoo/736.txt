I was 5. Molested by a family (a man and his wife who also forced their children to do acts on me) they were not relatives, they were being evicted from the apts my mom managed. Cruel people just looking to hurt my mom and I was their target. I’m 30 now and I’m stronger because of this, But I fight as hard as I can because it pains me to see others go through this.
