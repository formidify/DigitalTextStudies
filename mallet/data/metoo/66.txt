Was riding my bus ride to therapy and they were talking about the news and everyone getting called out, it was so nice hearing them say how the people need to go to jail but when I mentioned something happened to me they kept asking why I never went to the police... it’s been years, I was a child, I don’t even know the people who mostly did it....
