I was at my second home back in the day(a karaoke bar) Where almost all new my name.  Left with a group of friends to check out someone i was seeing elsewhere. Turned up not being there. Embarrassed got back to bar and slammed 2 or 3 yager bombs.  Owner said i couldn't drive than a guy ( rather not give the worth of even a name) Came up and said i could crash. Mingling with him before thought was ok. Even jokingly  said as i stumbled, "dont take advantage of me" well cut it short, he did i said the oh so,not magic words. Next morning was just going to brush it off but my dear friend( my hero,and a cop) saw me. Then of course the kit,the questions, and the WAIT!! 4 Years later he was found and justice finally got served. The ONLY  thing that any good came out of this is I became a stronger WOMAN! ! WE ARE SHE-RA  <3
