Ok so me too! I share this for my sisters and bothers who need to know this happens and it needs to STOP!Those who know my story know I lived through a very unusual childhood and therefore was exposed to a lot more opportunities to be victimized but that is no excuse for the men who felt it was ok to take advantage of me.From an age that has no  business even being thought of in this context, I had  been  sexually abused, molested and just flat out prayed open more times then I can count. ...so I share.1st time age 4,  "come sit on my lap" doesn't that feel good?2nd time age 6, "Come get a peanut butter and jelly sandwich " ...then watch me play with myself...3rd time, age eight, "Just let me kiss you" this is how grown ups do it...4th time "Don't tell your mom but if you touch it I'll give you $50...5th time, age 11; To the touch of a knife in my waist; fuck me or I'll stab you "6th time, age 13, "Your body is so sweet,...I promise this won't hurt" while my mom was in the other room....Almost the last time. Age 21; modeling for a marlin tournament in Hawaii. A man who was obviously not a fisherman posed with me and grabbed my ass .. Donald Trump.There were more times then I listed but that's enough to get my point across. I wish to state that with a lot hard work  I am no longer a victim or a survivor but a force to be reckoned with!
