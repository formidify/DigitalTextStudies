Just so everyone knows; lately I have realized that we have mentally sick people in this world, those who somehow justify molesting and abusing women and girls. I had no idea there were so many women and girls who experienced this until recently. To the women, you don't deserve that, and they are not justified. To the men, I know there are men who do not tolerate this, and I know there are those who somehow commit wrongful acts. The good news is there are many good men, who will not stand idly by, such as myself, and allow such actions, and who will prosecute the guilty. It's unfortunate women feel like they can't dress up beautifully, without being wary of this societal disease. Women shouldn't have to feel like they need to protect themselves. It is the responsibility and moral obligation of men to protect, provide, lead, and put an end to such awful behavior. For now I will be more cognizant about this issue, and if I encounter such behavior, I will use my power and authority to prosecute, by the strength of our legal system, my intuition, and physical dominance. The good men have more power, there are more of use, and we have the ability to end this hideous crime. To the women, please don't hide it when something like this happens, yet be wise with whom you tell first. It is not your fault this happened. You are worthy of love, respect, and protection. #IWill stand up. WHERE ARE ALL OF THE GOOD MEN STANDING UP FOR WOMEN, GIRLS, MEN, AND BOYS, WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS? It's baffling to me that I mostly see women standing up for this cause on social media and real life, yet I don't see a lot of men standing up for this. If you men cannot stand up for women, protect them, treat them as equals, and support women through this horrid issue, then you are not a real man, and you should be ashamed of yourself. Stand up for those who have gone through this. Let's put an end to this.
