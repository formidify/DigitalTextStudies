I'm 17, and my  has lasted most of my life. It started at 3, and the last occurence was a few months ago. It started with my dad's dad. Not only would he abuse me in every way he could, but he would always let people pay to do it as well. This started at 3 and lasted till 10. My parebts bever noticed it because they were always working, and my grandma could do nothing because she was bed ridden with cancer. Then came my cousin. I can forgive him because he didn't know any better. He was only a year older than me, and had severe autism. What I can't forgive was people refusing to believe it until my mom walked in on it. Next came my exes. Not just one or two. But almost all of them. Many of them dated me just for sex. One of them took it upon himself to force himself on me multiple times after we had broken up. No one would believe me, sadly... Until recently. Thankfully it's stopped. My life has been a long and bumpy road up to this point, but I've found a great support system to help smooth it out. ðŸ’–
