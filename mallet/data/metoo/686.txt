I posted this to my personal page a few weeks ago... seems appropriate to add the hashtag  I took this photo a couple of weeks ago & I contemplated several times to share it or not.. I went to post then would change my mind... for a lot of different reasons.. who would I upset, who would question it, who would have something negative to say, who would judge???.. but then I asked myself who would I encourage? Who would I motivate? Who would I save? With that being said here I am.   I joke a lot, I laugh a lot but I have a Story. A story that is soooo common unfortunately. All the words on my face below are part of me. Hidden behind the jokes, behind the laughs behind my personality is Me. Under this grown woman face is a helpless little girl.  It takes a lot to give off good energy. I work on it daily. For those who know me... it's probably like Jazz when?? Where??.. My answer is at home! #WhatHappensInThisHouseStaysInThisHouse is Garbage. I will never stand by this... Sexual abuse doesn't just happen with Strangers. A lot of the times it's by close family members & friends. Speak to your children, and STAND BY THEM. LISTEN TO THEM. This shit is real and it happens way too much!!! Watch who you bring around your daughters! I don't care how any one feels. I don't care if I offend anyone. I'm not here for you... Im here for those who need to know it's okay sis!!! You're not alone.  I encourage all the women around the world that if this has ever happened to you don't be a victim... be a Survivor. I don't embrace what has happened to me but damn it it's me. It's made me who I am today.. I turned My Bad to Good, My Weakness to Power, My Insecurities to Courage. I turned to alcohol a few years ago... Mannnn!!!! Smh. But I'm okay! That was part of my healing process. But I never healed. You dont ever really heal. You just deal! You just deal!!!! So I dealt with it. I had to face the fact that it happened.. to me.. as a child into my teens. Unfortunately you kind've deal with alone.. no one ever really wants to believe that their beloved family member is a sexual child abuser. You're a drama queen, you just want attention or you're spoiled. A few fuck yous to the non believers (excuse my English) but it's cool. Anyways back to who matters... Ladies just know its not your fault. You didn't deserve it. Talk to someone. You don't have to go through anything Alone. You deserve to be happy too. Fight depression, don't let it consume you. Be Great!!! This is part of my story. I have a few projects in mind to help spread awareness for it. I'm not drugged out and I have sanity because I'm supposed to help. I was called for it.
