At age 7 I was sexually assaulted and it lasted for around 6 years. I don’t even know how I remember how old I was.  It was by someone I loved, trusted, and admired.  It sadly was my father.  He passed away in a car accident but my pain lived on.  Although when he passed he had just become very religious; we never had the chance to talk about the issue.  His apologies died with  him.  I was left with writing this book “When You Cry, I Cry!  It is on Amazon and it tells my story of years of abuse starting with my father and continuing through relationships I have had.  I had no self esteem growing up and only now discovered that I am a Queen.  Today, October 19 is my 43rd Birthday and I thank God for healing my inside without the help of my abusers.
