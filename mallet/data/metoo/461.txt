My story is not a nice one and I won't go into to much detail but my innocence was taken from the one man who was suppose to protect me, my "dad" from the age of 10 to 16.  When I found out he touched my sister once I knew I had to put a stop to it so while he was away I told my mom she called the police and he was arrested and put away for 4 years. I suffered for a while and let it bring me down but when I had my first son I knew I couldn't let him ruin my life anymore. I am a survivor not a victim 💪🏻😊 I have an amazing family he died alone with no one! No one should ever have to go through these things but if you have don't let them win, don't let them keep ruining your life! Be strong be a survivor ❤️
