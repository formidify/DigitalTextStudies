I never knew it wasn't normal, I never knew boys weren't supposed to make you do things you d idnt want toI never knew why men used their strength against us. I did know, no-one cared. No one listened. I was the slut, I was over exaggerating. I wanted that life. If I only had known, if only one person would have listened. Why should I had to apologize all those years for the monster I had became. When no-one said sorry for making it that way. I thought I was raped by three different men. If only I would have known that the 10 others who sexually assaulted me would have gotten what they deserved to. Here's to a life consumed by anxiety and depression because to this day, I'm still just the slut who asked for it.
