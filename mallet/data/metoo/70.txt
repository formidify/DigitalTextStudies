I’m even protective over strangers kids...I’m working at the register... a little girl walks up... meanwhile I’m calling to help the next guest.This guy is just staring at this little girl that came up, his girl on the phone. So neither heard me.The little girl finished grabbing her drink, the same guy is checking her out, up n down. She’s like 7 or 8.Once she passed me, I yelled louder staring right at him... I can help the next guest!!!.... He looks at me knowing why I’m looking at him that way...Comes to my register... looking guilty... looks at me again... I couldn’t tell his facial expression...  but he knew he was caught!!!
