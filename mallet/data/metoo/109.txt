Raped when I was 22; took forever to get through it, but I did (which means so can you).  Mixed feelings about seeing so many of these prominent guys go down (e.g., I liked Louis CK), but I guess there's no way to change the world except having these guys feel as scared and vulnerable as we were.  Keep coming forward and telling what happened no matter what.
