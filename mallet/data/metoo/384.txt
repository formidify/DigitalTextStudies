The “” is indeed about being sexually assaulted or abused but many times for some reason you may get saved before a major physical damage is done. But you still suffer some emotional damage. It is also about you standing up for everyone who wasn’t as fortunate as you are.In a society where there are many discontented human beings, each one experiences some kind of abuse.
