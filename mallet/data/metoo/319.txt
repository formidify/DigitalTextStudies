My uncle would tell me he saw me being bad and I needed to be punished. Then he would molest and rape me.  I grew up hating myself.  I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror, I hated myself.  I blamed myself instead of the numbnuts who hurt me.  I attempted suicide so many times before I was able to come out of hiding and share, and finally realize it wasn't my fault.  I love the idea of this movement! I hope it helps so many survivors to put the blame where it belongs.  On the one who hurt you.  Hugs to all my fellow survivor's.  You have no idea how much your stories have helped me to heal a little more.   ðŸ’“
