I was hanging out with friends from work at a club I drove there on my own (sober)... It was a cool club We were all having a blast! I drank way, way too much I'm sure people out there know what I mean when I say that I was so drunk, but I could still pick up little bits of what my group was talking about They were discussing calling it a night I heard them talking about who was going to take me home I could tell they were talking about me being too wasted to drive home I think after that I stopped trying to pay attention The next morning I woke up, with just my shirt and no pants or panties, on a couch I looked around the place to see where I was... My GM (from my job) had taken me to his house Then I had memories in bits and pieces of what happened with him I remember being on my knees and being slung aside when he was done with me I can't remember how I got home I think I may have gotten someone to come and get me (not sure) This happened in 2000 The thing with me was I couldn't not talk about things with people It was so upsetting to me that I did speak up That's how I found out that I wasn't the only one he did that too I ended up testifying in court against him I quit my job after that because a few folks I worked with gave me the cold shoulder I didn't want to know anymore about it I moved on with my life... I regret that I didn't at least try find out what happened to him Thanks for having  to be able to talk about something that really messed up my life......
