i have never told anyone my story but after reading all your courageous stories I feel like maybe its time I let it outI was living in Darwin and addicted to Herion - 2 guys dragged me out of the pub and one raped me while the other one went through my bag and took my drugs and money. Sadly at the time I was more angry about them taking my drugs than anything, I didnt go to the police because I thought they would just say I was a junkie and do nothing. even though at the time I didnt think it affected me much as I was living on the streets anyway but I now know that it has affected my relationships with men. I find it very difficult to trust and have recently had an issue with a man who betrayed and lied to me and am finding it extremly difficult to get over. I am almost at the point where I absolutely HATE men and dont think i can ever trust one again. I had a very difficult relationship with my father which I also believe has affected my ability to have a ;normal' relationshio with a a man. i feel really broken and dont know how to mend myself again.
