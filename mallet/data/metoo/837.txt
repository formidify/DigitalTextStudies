My Story is one that my husband and I wrote-took over 5 years to do. Hard but glad it was done. Please check it out, Life with My Idiot Family A True Story of Survival, Courage and Justice over Childhood Sexual Abuse written by Kathy and Gary Picard in book and kindle on Amazon.I helped change Criminal and Civil SOL in MA, went through a 4 day jury trial and after trial a brain tumor removed! My stepfather sexual abused me 7-17 years old. My story is my whole life!! Thank you for your support!
