So what do you do when the perpetrator comes to visit the family and things go on as if it is all normal. MY sister tells me today that he came to visit 3 weeks ago -  I want them to say you are not welcome, what you did was wrong. don't come back. But they don't.  My mother goes numb and my sister sits with them. Funny enough my nephew arrives and announces to his girl friend, that the uncle that sexual abused Auntie Maria  GOOD ON HIM I SAY.  I was not here, my sister was not going to tell me and she did because the may return.  She says she does not know what to do. My mother does not know what to do. The act happened over 50 years ago . . . She says karma is taking care of it, all his kids are not happy and their realtaionships are failing. She says he looks like a little pathetic man.  Maybe this is so but it is not the same as my family standing with me and telling him he is was wrong and cutting him off.  I know that this act would change my cells.  any way on we go . . .
