The Cost,I understand the personal costs of speaking up. I understand how daily life can be exhausting, or consumed with the need for earning the resources to survive. I understand that personal needs supersede public or community needs. I understand how exhausting the idea of standing up for human rights is, without even doing anything. However, let's take a close look at those costs and list them. One is personal humiliation, however, does humiliation endure forever? Two is cost of time and effort, however, we all can learn to manage those effectively. Three is being publicly ostracized (called out, degraded), however, why waste energy worrying about what others think? Fourth, final and most important cost is, the continuation of abuse by abusive people, however this can be changed by uniting and investing time, energy and effort, to promote public awareness and to demand change by our governments...Please add any thoughts or ideas any of you may have about my comments...
