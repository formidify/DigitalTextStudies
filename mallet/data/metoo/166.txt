This is my storyI was abused over a few years 7-10 yrs old. I use to say it only happened a few times, but once is to much. I'm now 44 and it only came out in April last year. It has affected my life hugely. I have suffered depression for as long as I can remember, Ive had eating disorders. The day it came out I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Then in Feb this year I decided to make a formal statement and have my abuser charged. He was arrested and charged in June. Now I'm being prepared to go to court which could take up to a year. I have days where I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I'm scared if I do I won't stop. I still struggle every day, it's always there. Since going to the police I've had nightmares and I wake up scared,  angry. My husband has been my biggest support. Sometimes I wander why because he puts up with alot my moods, depression. His my rock.
