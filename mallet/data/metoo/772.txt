I struggled with what I went through with my ex stepdad for years after the abuse. He physically, mentally, and sexually abused me all through high school, while nearly putting my mom in the hospital on 3 separate occasions. My family still doesn't know, and I honestly don't even know if I'll ever tell them. But I've learned to deal with it through therapy and friends and, even though there isn't a week where he doesn't pop into my thoughts, at least he doesn't have power over my life anymore.
