I was twelve years old when Daddy died, and was tired of seeing all his friends packed in the funeral home , laughing, and joking with his body in a box at the front of the room. I swore I could see him breathing.. So I got out! I went outside for a walk. This was my town, Valley Stream. The funeral home was around the corner from the post office, that was across the street from our bank, that was around the block from our favorite pizza place. This was a part of town I knew well, it was a Monday or Tuesday afternoon, broad daylight. So there was, walking across the train station parking lot when an LTD load of boys drove by. The one in the front passenger seat had a head of bushy brown hair, leaned out the open window and said;"Hey little girl, why don't you lift up your dress , so I can lick between your legs?"I remember how I could hear the laughter from the guys in the back seat. I burst into tears, and ran towards the bank, only to realize I was in an alley between the two banks, became even more frightened, and ran back to the funeral home, where I was met by my "Aunt Dotty". Who promptly told me,"shut up, don't tell anyone this. After explaining, the lack of color in my face, the fact that I was running , crying, and out of breath. That's what I was told- "Don't say anything".This isn't nearly as horrible as some, but I share it because it had a deep hold on my life for many years. I followed Aunt Dotty's instructions from the week of July 6th 1979- till the summer of 1997. I finally told someone. I realized this had made me who I was, who I picked for a boyfriend. All aspects of my choice's were based here. My self worth, my opinions of the people in my life. I'm sure I must have told someone other then Dotty, but it wasn't until I told this one person, did I realize how deeply harmful this was to Me.Don't shut up! Tell it! Don't become a drunken loser with zero self worth, broken, and fearful. Take back YOU!!!! TELL EVERYONE!!!!
