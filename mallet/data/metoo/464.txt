Imma try to keep my storie short an sweet, but freshman year i was 15 an a senior who was a senior twice, talked to me. Long story short he started to threat me to sneek out an if i didnt he would hit me. So i did, i sneaked out every day for 3 months, and every night i was raped. And after he would rape me he would  "teach " me how fight but i end up being the punching bag, he also took me to partys an made me drink a lot or get stoned. I am 1 year and 8 months clean from weed. Now, it all started in January 2016.. im 17 know an he still followes  me arounf sometimes. And YES i did go to court but they found no evidence so they let him free...I still suffer PTSD and im always keeping an eye out. Its only been a year cents it happend. An im still in tharepy for it. Thats my story
