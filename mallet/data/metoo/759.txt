  - My uncle age 9 - then my biological dad (age 9 - 16) because I was growing into a woman (even took me out and introduced me as his wife once) - then in high school and right after by a man of "another culture" that believes in "taking and breaking" their women, then, because I desired love, I trusted ONCE AGAIN, in my 20's, found myself groomed - then threatened, forced and coerced into a life of sex trafficking for months. I am a TRANSCENDER..Not a Victim, Not merely a Survivor or OverComer...I am mentoring others and at times, share a synopsis of my story. It is not about me, but helping others overcome and shine.  Only by the grace of God am I able to be here today and discern who I trust. To know that my past consists of merely footprints to carry me to today. I pray for all those who have been victims of such atrocities that change "their identity" or strip them of who they truly are or can be..May you find yourself once again and be your SELF. You BELONG TO NO ONE. You are NO ONE"S SLAVE.  They no longer can enslave your identity for their gain.
