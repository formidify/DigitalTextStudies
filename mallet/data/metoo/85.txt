All i can remember all my life is comments about my chest ,from men and women , i was 13yrs old babysitting for a woman round the corner from my home .her boyfriend would get back b4 her telling me they didnt make them like that when he was at school .15yrs old day work from school at a old peoples home there egg delivery man following me down the corridor asking me out telling me my chest was magnificent. From my early 20s tried to get a reduction on the NHS physio recommend i have it done but no wouldnt do it .All my adult life i have had unwanted attention from both sexes women been bitches men just Ogling. Until now at 53yrs i have paid 4 a reduction and its the best thing ive ever done .when i meet people now 4 the first time they are seeing me and not my chest.
