I said "NO"! and I RAN down an old fashioned hand-operated elevator shaft, from an office after being told "look out in the office when you leave, someone is going to get the magazine cover", from Steppenwolf, from more powerful Chicagoans I can remember. Couldn't pay my rent, my landlord came for me too.  Said no then too. Married to a former Bouncer, a powerful guy who still keeps me safe and sane,  I came back to my passion: older, less naive and ready again to put my heart out there for the reputable world to see.  Funny thing, is the older I got, the less people want to see my heart.  Thank you for sticking up for the young ones!!!!  Stay safe and true to your art!
