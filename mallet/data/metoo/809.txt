  The first time a stranger when I was 12 years old.  Then a boss when I was 16.  Another boss when I was 20 years old.  I went through therapy to help get past the horrible feelings.  But the day a sexual predator was elected president, all of the horrible feelings came back.  I just keep asking myself how do people think it is okay?
