. Molested by a "friend of the family" when I was four or five until I was nine. Then my father molested me until I was 13 when I told my mother. Then it got way worse. My mother threw my father out and called his brother. He showed up and was violent. Nights and days of screaming and beating my Dad. He raped my mother which got her pregnant. My father "took her back" along with me, my little brother and baby sister. He told my mother she "could stay" but she had to give the baby up for adoption. He put her in a home for unwed mothers and after the baby was born and given up, she was "allowed" to return. Within two years of her returning home, I married a man five years older than me, whom I had known one week. (I was 16 and he was 22). We were married for 22  years and had five children (several of them having nothing to do with me). I never learned how to parent and I can't blame them. I made all sorts of mistakes. Hind sight is always 20/20. We divorced in 1993. I hold nothing against.him or my children.My childhood was filled with screaming, name calling and so much more. The psycological abuse was really bad too.I survived! I found help with a non-profit organization that changed my life and the lives of the people I work with! I am blessed to have a wonderful husband of 23 years and the opportunity to help others.The Sun does outlast the Storm!Blessings!
