The worst part is, my "friends" knew what happened at that party and still hang out with HIM. Edit: and the DA didn't deem it enough to go to court!! The traumatic experience doesn't go away, and sometimes the nightmares return, but your strength to go out in public again and see your worth once more does come back. Be strong ladies. #survivor #2yearsstrong #ptsd
