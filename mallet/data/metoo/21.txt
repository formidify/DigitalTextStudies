I was at the races with my husband ..and as I sat there I watched people go by.. But to be honest I noticed what other women were wearing... Not once did I think she should be harmed.. I looked at them as women coming out in their best to impress...As women we dress to our own taste...when I was younger I wore the same clothes I see going women wearing today... I felt I was young and I look banging so why not show myself off.. to make me feel good about me... I take delight in dressing a different way now..because my taste have changed... I think its called sexy mature...However the biggest moment I noticed was when I saw them as women who all have a story
