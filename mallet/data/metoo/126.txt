Age 8 first inappropriate touch from a man about  45 years old.  I told him I was going to tell on him and stop. He did not I told his niece she begged me not to tell ,  I told.  That cost me the friendship with the niece her family. In addition my younger cousin who had the same man touch her inappropriately stayed quiet because she watched the family angry at me not believe me. I was the one that got in trouble for his behavior.
