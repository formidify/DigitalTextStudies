Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and for being able to help others, being in the same situation and share our thoughts and stories about  sexual abused and physical or  mental abuse in our lives won't make us victims, this is a wonderful way of helping each other with love and compassion, I'm glad that I found support here on this Facebook page, even that we are miles apart and different ages we all are women and men who go through same situation and we help each other as humans beings, sexual abuse is real and keep it in dark is not the answer, as a survivor I want to let you know that we are not alone on this path of healing.ðŸ’™
