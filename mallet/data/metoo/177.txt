By far all of you know about the  #movement. One thing I can’t understand is - why do we need a #celebrity to endorse our beliefs. After #Alyssa #Milano tweeted “me too” a huge number of #real #life #stories of #sexual #assault came to surface. Will the #women and #girls speak only when a #mogul like Harvey Weinstein is criticized by #Hollywood? We all are the women of #21thcentury; have the freedom to speak and liberty to lead our lives. #Harassment to women has been a part of the culture especially in India where countless women are victims of domestic violence. If the #Me #Too response came 10 years prior when Ms #Tarana #Burke started her #campaign; #Harvey #Weinstein would be sued during his first few attempts. On several occasions I did not had the autonomy to wear what I wanted to just because I do not grab attention from a boy. Why? I have to wear long shirts inside of the stunning designer toppers I was dying to wear. I suppressed by desire to dance during public events because a group of boys were in front line. How a girl dressed herself or looks can’t not change the perspective of a person (be it a boy or a girl) than why are we advised to cover all over. Wake up #boys and #young #ladies. Don’t be a follow the moment only because it is in trend; bring change in yourself and respect each other’s dignity. Feel and act.
