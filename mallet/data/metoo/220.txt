I was in an HR position where I thought my hard work gave me that promotion. I worked for men in a plant governed by men. I watched women with skill and balls be passed by for promotion to give it to a man.  One day my boss showed me pictures of a female  employee who was with a coworker sexually. The pics were being sent to everyone anonymous. My boss and I called a potential person  up and to "demonstrate" the offensiveness he demonstrated on me in a room with this employee present. My boss asked this employee if he thought I was a whore too. The boss is in a major multi billion company that makes toilet paper.
