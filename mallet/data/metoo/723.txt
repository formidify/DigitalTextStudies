Can't talk about it.....But  And it's been 6 years m 21 now but m still there.....I m still not medically or emotionally over it yet..... I can never be bcz it's easy to say move on but personally I feel u never can move on from such a haunting memory that just made u a different person.... I've tried counseling n it rarely helped..... I couldn't share it with my family back then bcz I have 2 more sisters their freedom could have been lost, my father has heart problem I could'nt tell him..... Me telling my family could have also resulted affecting my sister's education n it would have ruined their life as well..... I was quite then I am quite now..... I don't trust people, I rarely make friends, I am emotionally weak and emotionless at the same time.... Also I would want to thank you for giving much importance to so many lives...
