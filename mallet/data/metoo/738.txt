,  my first memory I was 5 years old. It continued for 10 years until I finally spoke up and told someone.  These days I get told to cheat on my husband, I have my car blocked in by a guy that wants me to go home with him, I have men stare at my backside licking their lips telling me id have a good time. I am already a nervous wreck going out in public thanks to my abuser but the men out there today make me scared to go anywhere without my amazing husband so I  invested in pepper spray for those times I have to go out alone.Speak up, join the movement, your not alone
