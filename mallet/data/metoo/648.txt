When you are too young to understand because of the lies and shame placed upon you you are stuck in quicksand😟Then you are a teen and it seems the eyes are always watching, and again raped then ... there are too many words to much to tell so much to say  let’s listen to one another and bear one another’s burdens and allow healing within our souls 💞💝
