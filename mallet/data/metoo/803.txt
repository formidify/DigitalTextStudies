 Some time ago after dancing salsa on Friday at Putney... one very well known and characteristic in London's dancin society guy followed me and my friend after we left the venue. Still can't forget it and every time I see him I have goosebumps all over my body and flashbacks from that evening ðŸ˜žnot strong enough to report it as I'm feeling guilty that I was trying to smile while I wanted to release from him...my friend was chatting with his friend and she didn't realize that I'm in serious trouble as she couldn't see me or hear me...was helped by a stranger who was closing the door from the flat. I used this second and run away safely... THANK YOU STRANGER! never never never wish anyone from my dancin family to have that experience ðŸ˜žTerrible guy... I hope he won't hurt anyone ðŸ˜ž This  attention that I read today gave me some courage to open my mouth in public! Thank you.
