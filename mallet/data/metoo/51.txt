One day as I had a long beautiful conversation with my husband I had a horrible flash back to a horrible moment in my childhood.. and that sensation froze me, it caused me to push away my husband,, I started to panic...and he was confused.. so I explained and I also realized that it was the scent that he had put on.... but I closed my eyes and saw what was confronting me... and I faced it... eventhough it was hard and scary...and then I choose to live happier.. to not carry my back hunched because I feel ugly or fat,not to keep feeling as if something is worng with me still....It took sometime of raw honesty to myself and then  I overcame that emotion that could have caused me to do something harmful or regretful...That is what sexual abuse does to the person it afflicts its harm on... The emotion of feeling like a human.. happy ..having faith in God eventhough as a child you don't seem to have to be taught...Children are brought into this world with the emotion, composition and personality to whom they will be as an adult... When a child is  abused a little one stumbles.... they doubt their sanity, their outlook on life.. they become stuck in a pattern in their head that seem acceptable until something insides them break and they see the wounds being caused....They feel robbed of being or having a  future husband or wife,, mother or father.. a person of influenceI am asking those who have been abused to look inside your heart and Call your Victory ..Your Salvation into being.. You have something to make your space Happy, Wonderful to be in.. And its inside of you... Choose The Person you were going to be When your daydreams were happy and your other dreams were peaceful....I choose Her... I was  but I want #LookMeNow..I want Victory , Salvation, ,Joy..
