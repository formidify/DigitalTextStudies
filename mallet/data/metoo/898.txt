Thanks for adding me. So many incidents, from age 12 being chased away from my friends and pinned down by an older boy twice the size of me, to this Saturday at 39, dancing in a club, and a fairly left wing hippy kind of club, feeling something touching me and I when I turned round it was a guy rubbing his groin on me. Via two rapes and two attempted rapes, all in my own home by people I trusted. Oh and waking up at 6am while sleeping over in a friend's house to find her partner (who I've know for 10 years) standing over my bed with his cock in his hand. I do think the focus needs to be turned on the perpetrators though, and what it is that makes them lose their humanity to such and extent that they do that?  Of the people I knew that sexually assaulted me, all of them had some kind of mental health issues and at least one was abused as a child. None of this was my fault or excused their behaviour, but as a society maybe we need to focus on how these men can feel more whole, so that they don't need to exert their power over vulnerable people. And so we can just get on with living our lives...
