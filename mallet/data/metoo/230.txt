I have to admit, when I stumbled across this site my mind said things like "it's too public and this is my personal business. Oh really...you're gonna join a group of people whining about what happened to them? What if I get negative feedback or judgment  from schmucks and it makes me turn inward and feel not sufficient enough to speak my truth? Am I weak for joining because after all of these years I should 'have it together' and be 'over it'? Maybe I'm too sensitive and this will dredge up too many emotions I have learned to 'try' to bury." Again, this is what my mind played out....but these weren't MY thoughts. These are the imposed thoughts of a society that doesn't want to be reminded of how messed up things can be. These are the thoughts that one acquires and endures because the secrecy of being violated creates an endless rabbit hole of insecurity and questioning of oneself. But guess what? I have found this site to be most cathartic and isn't it so nice to know there's a place to share where others 'get it'? So I say, keep the page. Maybe I will find courage soon to share my experiences too. In the meantime, (pardon my 'french') fuck the trolls. Empowerment begins with a voice in spite of the ignorant and the naysayers. Much love and I hope no one found any of this offensive.
