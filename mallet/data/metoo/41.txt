I was date raped twice while serving in the Navy over seas. I dont think of myself as a victim. I think of myself as a strong person who survived and flourished regardless of what happened to me! Do not give them the Power! It was difficult to pull myself up after the initial attacks but with determination and support I have been triumphant! Take back your power!
