I was 6 when my tutor asked me to sit on his lap to teach me math,  he was a 40yr old I guess. He put his hand down there and covered with the book and started pressing there. There were 6 other students sitting there including my younger sister. I took it for two days and told it to my mother the third day as it started paining terribly.
