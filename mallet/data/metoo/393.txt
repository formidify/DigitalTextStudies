This is a guy I went to school with, technically grew up with.. And what they don't say in the article is that it's his own daughter (the 8 year old girl) and that he sexually assaulted UNDERAGE coworkers. I'm sorry, but something to that extent where it's like numerous children, deserves a penalty more than just a few years in prison, (cause North Dakota's justice system is bass backwards throwing people in prison for 10+ years for selling pot, and child molesters get less than 2, and their protected!!) Just an open opinion.Sorry had to share with you guys cause I'm kinda irate about this..
