I've been sexually (physically) harassed by a well dressed middle age man in a bus while on vacation in an European capital when I was 15 years old. After he grabbed my breasts from behind and called me "a little whore" while licking my ear, I've elbowed him hard in the face, was arrested by the police for "assault" and "breach of the peace" and had to hear an hour long and humiliating preach from the local authorities on how a foreign girl should dress and behave in public transportation before being released. I'm 27 now and trust no one.
