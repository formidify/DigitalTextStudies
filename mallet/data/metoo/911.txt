It was bad enough to be the victim of constant sexual harassment as a young girl, but what made it worse was growing up in a house where if something bad happened to you, then YOU must have done something to cause it.  That is why I have never discussed this until today, some 50 years later.  Much love to all of you who are making your voices heard today.  We are braver than we may have realized. ❤️
