Is it possible to feel "over it" for years after you were abused? Its been almost 9 years and only during this last year I have experienced what seems to be symptoms of PTSD. It is ruining my relationship with my fianc√© because he just can't understand how all of the sudden I don't want to have anything to do with him sexually.
