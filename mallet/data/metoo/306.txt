***** ANONYMOUS POST *****“As a child, I did not know the name for it, when the harassment happened to me. All I knew was that it made me feel uncomfortable and I do not like it. A lot.I told my mom about it, seeking for a validation for my feelings. Instead, I was told that it was my own fault and not to bring it up again as it creates an awkward situation between the adults.So I pushed my feelings down, wrapped it up, and place it in a dark corner of my mind, with the intention to bury it with other forgotten memories. Of course, it never gets buried for long.As I was growing up, I see and hear similar incident from books, magazines, news ... and obtained the validation I was looking for. The fact that ideally, it should not happened. The fact that bottom line is, it is not right. The fact that I should not be blamed and penalized for something that was not my fault to begin with. Thank you .Bringing it up to my mom to achieve some closure, I was told that the reason why I am bringing it up to the surface again is due to my inability to see the bigger picture that requires me to pretend nothing ever happened.  That I possess selfishness for not willing to make a sacrifice for a greater good, keeping the family together.Bringing it up to my friends, some told me I should not waste my time to talk about it as there is no point talking about the past. I should just move on. Some told me that I am just trying to get some attention for airing something that is embarrassing. So I guess, either way ... it was wrong for me to talk about it then”
