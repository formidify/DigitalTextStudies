I was a freshman in college when a friend tried to grab my pussy in public. That same year, another friend raped me. I pleaded for him to stop, that he was hurting me, but he didn't listen. And when he was done, he left me there without a word. Six years later, an older man that I trusted to protect me raped me as well. It took me years to admit to myself that I was raped. I buried it deep in my mind for years until it all came crashing back when I saw them again, one in person and one in a photo. I am going to therapy and am on medication for depression, anxiety, and PTSD.
