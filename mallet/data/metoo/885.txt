He is my uncle, I was 4. It went on for a few years until I was in second grade, and realized that what was going on wasn't right. He'd convinced me that it had been my idea, that I was the one pursuing him. I was mortified that he'd tell, so i started to opt out of visits to his house. I made myself forget the abuse, and I made up lies that would plaster over the abuse. When i was in college, something triggered the real memories, it was like an avalanche that consumed my mind, body and soul. I still haven't confronted him, but he's dying slowly, and that makes me happy. Even 32 years later, I don't remember all of the abuse that went on during those years, and I still find it difficult to articulate the effect it had on me.
