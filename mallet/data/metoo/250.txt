Today’s postsOk everyone how are well all.???I’ve decided the time has come to stop reacting to the trolls and the fake posts. They want us to react and they want to silence you and get you to leave the group and take your voice with you.This group is about standing up and been counted and not letting anyone bring us down.So if you see any more fake posts we will react with our strength. 💪No more words no more explaining or justifying ourselves.There is enough to inform on the page given by me for people to work out what is happening and what we want to achieve. If people are worried they can do their research and see what’s been happening. As always it is all public for everyone to see.. that’s what we want! People to seeSO NO MORE!!! SHARE AND GATHER YOUR SISTAS....Reply to all posts about selling stories or fake pics with the emoji for solidarity or strength 💪🏿✊🏻 no words no justification just strength. They will keep trying but if we can hold firm they will not win. Anyone with real concerns will look over what we have posted and get the answers and understanding they needs the last posts accusing us have been from fake profiles.. so no more apologising or feeding these people... Just ... ✊🏻 or 💪Do we get it? Shall we do this??? Let’s go!!!
