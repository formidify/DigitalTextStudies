I am new to this group. I have been reading posts to get a feel for what I would be facing here. Its been 16 years since the last physical abuse that I went thru. I have in the past told certain loved ones that I was a survivor. I use the word "Survivor" because that is what we are. We once may have been victims but I refuse to be labeled as such. Surviving is the resilience we earn for continuing life after what for many of us can say was a death sentence. Anyway, I digress. being new I am hesitant to share my story as I have never told another soul EVER. At least not in detail. I believe it may be time for me to face what I have gone through and share my past with fellow survivors. Maybe  my story might help another woman. Maybe my story will finally help me come to terms with the after effects and the debilitating anxiety that now consumes my daily life. I will present my ENTIRE story in a 3 part post. I am working up the courage to articulate as accurate as I can remember.  my question for the forum is: what isn't allowed to be posted?my details are graphic and not for the faint of heart. The posts I have read have been inspiring. yet I fear that we as women and as survivors don't fully come to terms with our past and while I struggle to tell  people in my personal life, I believe I can reach more here on this page, ultimately conveying my message of hope. I do want to know what the extent of what I can or can not post. please advise and stay tuned.
