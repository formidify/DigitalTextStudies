 Family “friend” @ age 4; family members @ ages 6 and 14; boyfriends and various people @ different jobs throughout my life. I sometimes wonder what kind of woman I could have been if these incidents had not occurred.💔However the reality of it has brought awareness that I use daily: to connect and empathize with others who have similar stories (sadly there are many), to trust my gut and protect my precious children, and to try to teach them (as well as model for them) how important it is to use your voice.
