Only begun regaining memories back four years ago, I was raped as a baby and ritually abused by people in the churches we went until I was thirteen and we moved away somewhere far from the bad men. I live with multiple mental illnessâ€™s caused by the abused and chronic pain also possibly rooted in it.
