I am so thankful for this site.    This secret almost destroyed me.  I feel weights lifting off of me.I was molested repeatedly by my brother.    We had different fathers.   My father treated his natural kids different from his step children.  He justified his action as to punishing me for how my father treated him.   He said he hurt me because I was the closest person to my father.   It started when I was three and he was 13.    This went on for years.    I confronted him when I turned 16 and he said, “Yes I did it.   Get over it.    Life goes on.”    30 Years later, To this day, I am still uncomfortable around him.
