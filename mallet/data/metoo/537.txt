It was my mother's husband. I was 5 he would drink and as soon as my mother left for work he would rape me. He messed me up bad inside and mentally.  I remember holding towels down there to catch the blood. This went on for a while. My real father is the one who noticed something was wrong with how I acted and got me help.
