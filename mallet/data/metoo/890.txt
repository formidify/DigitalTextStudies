I can't remember all of the times I just didn't say NO even though i wanted to... while they took me I pretended to be asleep hoping they would stop... And came inside me. 3 of them gave me std's. One (ex)boyfriend decided to roll me over at 4 am, ripped down my pants and shoved his member in dry. I cried through it. and he later broke up with me. Sexual assault is never a joke or something we can't take part in to end. I was naive. Thinking I deserved it... Thinking it just meant i was desirable. IF they don't say YES, don't touch them! It's simple. If they are intoxicated, DON'T touch them! We need to end the entitlement these types of people feel. We do not owe them our bodies just because their brain says they get what they want. Luckily I am teaching my young daughter to be brave and strong. She will have the confidence to approach a situation better than i ever did.
