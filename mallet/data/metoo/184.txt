***** ANONYMOUS POST ******This person asked me to post their story for them .My story is a strange one and I don't want to go into details because it is SO unique that explaining how I grew up and who raised me etc would give me away. I will say thought that my abuser was the only person I had in my life.... my whole life. I had no other family members around. I do have children and I don't allow him alone with them. It would probably be much better if I disowned him. Maybe I could get past things easier. He is all I've ever known though, and I feel a sense of loyalty to him. "He didn't have to raise me", "He could have left too". I'm all he's had too. His health isn't at its greatest, and I can't just let him die alone.A few years ago I did confront him in an email about one of the situations he put me through as a child. He cried and apologized. He said he wished he could take it all back. Since then I've felt some sort of relief. Having children of my own though has brought back some fears. He doesn't understand what I've been through emotionally for over 20 years. He doesn't know how he's affected my relationships, or my fears when it comes to my own husband with my children. Part of me wants to bring it up again, but I feel at this point it would be like beating a dead horse. I feel like I have other people in my life that would find out I was talking about it again, and accuse me of just wanting attention. I mean... what good does bringing it up again and again do. If I can't get over it... I probably should distance myself from him. It makes me feel sick to my stomach when I tell people my story (like my husband), or even strangers like you, and I have to somehow explain why I would still keep this person in my life.
