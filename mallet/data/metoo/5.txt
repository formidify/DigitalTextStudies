That DressThat dress is beautiful on you,But you shouldn't wear it.Someone might rape you if you wear that dress.That dress is just asking for it!Put it back on the rack!You must dress modest to not be attacked.You deserve the promotion,But you won't get it.Everybody knows the CEO is a chauvinist.If you want the promtionthere may be regretsAnd you probably should go ahead And wear that pretty dress.Â© Copyright Renee Belden
