If people are feeling sad about not being able to be open about it, remember you're not forced to put. This campaign doesn't invalidate or negate the ones who are not putting. We who are putting these statuses we have been there and we know how hard it is. You don't have to be sorry, you don't have to be sad.. This is not to invalidate your feelings. This is for the ones who CAN. Who are fine with letting people know and it's not an obligation. It's just a choice some of us made. And if you don't want that's more than fine. You're brave anyway carrying your  along like a brave warrior. Proud of you.
