I can't even recant my stories. Not today at least. Maybe later when I'm not ovewhelmed by all the women and even celebrities breaking their silence on social media publically or in closed groups.But what I will do is to use my voice to empower other women to speak up and begin the healing process. One in 4 women are sexually abused as children or adolescents. I AM 1 in 4 but I AM A SURVIVOR. The Younique Foundation, Inc has a FREE Haven Retreat where women who have been sexually abused as children or adolescents can be to begin the healing process. It's easy to apply and I hear the experience is life chaning. You do not need to be a younique customer or presenter to take advantage of this opportunity. I can put you in contact with my y-sisters who have attended, if you want to learn what the experience is like.  They have nothing but good things to say about it.  Any you share will not be shared with others.  #safezonelearn more here >>> YouniqueFoundation.org
