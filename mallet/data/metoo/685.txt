I was told so many times... it was my fault... for being where I was... when I was... and... I've believed that for so many years... literally... this  challenge has given me the strength to UNDERSTAND... it wasn't my fault... I didn't want it... and I see so clearly... I'm not alone... thank you so much for adding me...
