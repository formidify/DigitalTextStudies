Thank you for letting me join the group.Childhood sexual and emotional abuses since babyhood through puberty and beyond by different people stays with us all of our lives. It has shaped all of my life decisions .It hasn’t been easy but now that I have reached the ripe old age of 70  I consider myself a survivor. I have left behind the guilt of thinking all of them were all my fault and none of them were so I gave it back to my abusers where it belongs by journaling everything that happened over the years. I wrote a 350 page manuscript that now sits at the bottom of my dresser. All of the abusers are now dead. I haven’t decided whether I should share it or just burn the whole thing.There are way too many of us that still carry such heavy burdens.Hopefully someday we will all be healed.
