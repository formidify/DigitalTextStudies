"In regards to Count 1: Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree, the people of the jury find the defendant GUILTY. In regards to Count 2: Sexual Abuse in the Second Degree, the people of the jury find the defendant GUILTY."This just happened today. I literally cannot believe it. This case was originally filed back in 2001 when I was 11, but nothing was done with it. Now, as a 27 year old, I re-filed the charges and have been working towards court since June, and today I got a guilty verdict. These last few months, and ESPECIALLY these last 3 days have been very hard, but I am so happy that I did this and that I am finally getting justice. That's really all the emotions I can describe right now because I am literally SWIMMING in them, but I truly feel at peace and happy. https://chasity08.wixsite.com/hopeliveshere
