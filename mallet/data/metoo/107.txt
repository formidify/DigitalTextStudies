I was violated by a dr. and went to authorities now I’m the perpetrators. Funny after I went public there are others who also came forward after it was televised. Today I am still in a living nightmare I totally can’t stand drs. I don’t trust them I have a hard time letting my husband touch me and I’m angry inside. They try to make me out to be a liar. The dr I was told is powerful and a pillar in the community like so what so am I. The defense treats me like I’m a liar but what about the other women are we all lying? There were other charges before me that I knew nothing about. Now I understand why women fear coming forward in fear that no one would believe them. Well my life is hell and I just want my life back I have nightmares, anger issues, fear of his power, and a broken intimate life and it sucks.
