For my 4 sister's 5 nieces I applaud your strength and your willingness to share. It hurt me to my core thinking this could happen to anyone of the women I love so dearly in my life. It hurt me bringing me back to my childhood sweetheart that I dated and she was molested as a child and then later raped by a soldier and was told after I told her to tell by her grandmother no need to ruin his career (The nerve of her own grandmother)... for my future wife and all the women in my life you are strong, amazing, and beautiful!!!  #MenIfYouCareRepost
