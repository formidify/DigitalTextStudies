It is true that both sexes are victimized, it is women by far that have to deal with the daily assault on body and mind.  In 1982 a little thing called the ERA, Equal Rights Amendment was defeated by narrow-minded women and chauvinistic mean-spirited men.Ladies this IS the time to unite.  Enough of this BS!!  There are a majority of men who stand beside you, not behind you, even older guys like me.  Make this and every women's rights grievance (pay, etc.), an issue that all men and your governmental representatives cannot ignore.  Rise up and demand protection under the laws of not only of your states but of this country!
