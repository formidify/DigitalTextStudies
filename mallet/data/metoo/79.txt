A photo of my happy ending. Our five year wedding anniversary. Jerry and I got married in 2010. I divorced my first husband in 2003. After being abused by my parents and grandparents, disinherited b/c I told about my childhood abuse, and as an adult married to a verbally abusive man for 20 plus years, I am now married a second time. Happily so!
