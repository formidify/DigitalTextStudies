I am proud of Ms. Tarana Burke's efforts in spearheading the "Me To" campaign 10 years ago. It is great to see this campaign is being once  againrevived. I can add myself to the list  of  "" .  At age 11 I was sexually molested by a 15 year teenager while I was playing at a neighborhood friend's house. I never spoke of this incident because I was afraid and ashamed. Then in my own home, unknown to my mother who was suffering with alcoholism, I endured  frequent sexual "psychological" harassment from a trusted older male family member. I endured this harassment from the time I was 12 to 15 years old. I had the strength to say "no, you will not make me do what you want me to!"  I also had mastered a way of finding  places to spend large blocks of  my weekend time. I felt safe when I was outside my home. I'd spend time in  church or I'd  pursue my musicial activities. My goal was to never be home alone when this family member "predator" would come by for weekend visits.My faith in God and my awareness of his love  for me sustained me throughout this ordeal. I pray this post helps someone know that they are not alone.
