I am new to the group I am 15 years old and I was molested by my older brother. I lived in Washington homeless with my mom,dad and grandma and life was hard in motels and my brother flew me to California I left by myself away from friends and family I knew to live with him and his girlfriend and 2 kids I never met. After 2 years of living there it happened and when it did I did not know how to react I was scared to tell anybody because I was worried about ruining the family and how my 5 year old niece would miss her dad and if people would be mad at me. I acted normal like Nothing was happened and did not say stop even he did it under the blanket and pretended he was tickling me on the couch when my other niece was on the couch of course she thought I was Being tickled I Iaugphed to help hide it only out of fear and shock. I thought life was going to be better in cali untill that happened. But my sister in law is awesome and I still live in cali life is great I have a amazing boyfriend that keeps me happy he doesnt even have to try. Of course I told so nothing happens to my niece.
