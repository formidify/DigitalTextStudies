I'm not very good at explaining things but here goes... I was molested by my male cousin when I was 5 or 6. My female cousin *his sister* was supposed to be watching me but she left me alone with him. And I don't remember exactly what happened anymore all I remember is what movie was playing..The little Mermaid but I did end up telling my Parents and she told my but she didn't believe her..and they ended up not talking for a while.. But sadly it was never pursued past that so I never got justice. Fast-food to a ex that doesn't know how to keep his hands to himself who forced me more the once to have sex with him and I did cause I was afraid that if I didn't me and my current bf at the time would lose our place to live... Fast forward to this year and was again was "pressured" into having sex with him because he wouldn't leave me alone and I felt like I as no way out...I feel terrible for letting him do things to me...
