Posted earlier today on Snapchat. My family didn't know what happened, except my kids' dad. I didn't want to post it in a public forum yet, because my family knows him and would probably hurt him. I am praying for everything that has ever dealt with this. I was not raped or molested, but I felt horrible about what happened to me and I can't imagine what it was like to expose the truth.
