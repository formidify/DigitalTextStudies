(Copied from my personal time line) He was a respected member of our church. I was only 9 years old. I told no one because I was scaredHe was a family member and a respected member of many service organizations and his community. I was only 10 years old.I told at 17 and lost many loved ones for it.He was the older next door neighbor I had a crush on. I was only 13. I never told "because I asked for it."He was the respected and admired teacher. I was only 14. I told by accident and got in trouble for it.He hired me to clean his house. I was 15 and just trying to earn spending money for school clothes. I never told because "he was drunk and wouldn't remember and I needed the money anyway."He was with his friends and I was drunk. I was 18. I never told because I was in the military.They told and I got a horrible reputation for it.He was my husband. I was trying to be a "properly submissive Christian wife." I told. I was threatened with removal of my children from my care if I "caused any more problems"He was my boyfriend and the man I lived with. I didn't tell, I left the day I found out he was trying to pimp me out.He was the guy on the Greyhound that molested me when I fell asleep. I never told. I was single. I didn't have anyone I felt I could tell.He was the random dude at the bus stop calling me "sexy" and asking me to go home with him for "a hondo". I was 46. I told my partner. He held me tight and made me feel safe.He was the guy walking down the street asking me as I stood in a quiet part of town waiting on my ride home after a gig if I wanted to "party baby" with that awful leering grin that is somehow supposed to be attractive. I didn't answer him. I came home and found all the  stories in my newsfeed on Facebook and decided to stand up for all the silent 's out there. This is my history of sexual assault and harassment. #mystory #youarenotalone
