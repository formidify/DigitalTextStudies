 I was 19 and working at a bar on a military base. Met a guy while I was working, seemed nice enough and when he asked me out I said Yes! We met up at the bar and had a couple of drinks. He asked if I wanted to walk around and (I admit I was naive) fell for the I forgot something in my room, come on we were on a military base, I should be safe right? After he was done with me, I needed 2 surgeries before things were healed. That whole time in his barracks room, only 1 person ever knock on his door to see why I was screaming and he didn't do anything to help.
