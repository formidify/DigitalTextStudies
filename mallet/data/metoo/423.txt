I was sexually harassed by my boss when I worked at an engineering firm in Houston. He was the big shot exec and I was the nothing. He was an ugly pizza face freak who thought he was going to get away with it. I was loud and not shy about exposing him. I got a small settlement. If I knew then what I know now, that settlement would've been a lot larger.
