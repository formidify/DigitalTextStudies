I wasn't going to do this but now I am........,On March 7th 2017, I was raped by a man that I let into my apartment. I thought I knew him and thought he would do no harm. That night was horrific, the report filing, the rape kit, having to relive it over and over. Some days I still can't leave my house. Some days are better than others. I've stayed silent about this to a lot of people but if this helps another girl or guy (it happens to men too) I can share my story. I'm still very much knee deep in it. I've thought past months about taking my life. Today I'm better, I have PTSD but I continue to fight! Some days I don't know why but I do. As my officer friend says "it's always darkest before the dawn" #7119. Thank you for listening, one step at a time. Just for today!
