When I was 15 I had a few guy freinds.   One day I went to one of their houses and he said he wanted to get drunk with me.  We had 1 shot of baileys each and when I said it didn't affect me,  he pressured me to drink a cup full of straight gin. He didn't have any.  He kept acting all drunk and silly,  pretending he didn't remember having a girlfriend and trying to kiss me,  and I kept saying no and reminding him of his girlfriend.He offered to show me around the house as I hadn't been there before and took me to his room. I don't remember much,  I just know that next minute I was lying down and I told him to stop. He was taking my pants off and I was asking "what are you doing? " "stop"  I blocked out most of the rest,  but I remember when he finished he ran  to the toilet and threw up I was so confused,  I didn't know what was going on. He said his parents were going to be home soon,  so he gave me a piece of bread, shut me outside  and left me to walk home. He somehow convinced me that he had also been drunk and that it was a misunderstanding and that he actually liked me and we ended up being friends for months before he started bragging to a mutual friend that he was never drunk in the first place and got away with it.  It was a year later that I went to the cops and by then it was too late.I have DID which I believe was triggered in my childhood so there are likely to be some instances I don't remember. In 2015 at an Easter BBQ at a grandparents house,  I was groped by my mums dad. It was in front of everyone but nobody noticed because it was time to hug people goodbye and I was wearing a poncho like thing..He then followed me inside and cornered me on the stairs and tried to do it again but I said don't and then I ran to the car and told mum and dad what happened. I thought maybe this guy is behind my childhood trauma too?
