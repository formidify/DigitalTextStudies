 - thanks for adding me. The situation I experienced wasn’t near as traumatic as some of other women’s circumstances captured, yet it still has lead to shame and reduced trust in boys/men. I think I was only 14, I was alone, in a large shopping mall and some random boy grabbed me “down there” on the escalator. I was shocked and startled, felt trapped and did not have the courage or conviction to call him on his actions and push him away or say this was wrong. I can’t believe some boys/men still feel this behaviour was okay. While not as severe a story as others it still haunts and affects me, even though it was years ago. Finding your voice to stand firm is tough.
