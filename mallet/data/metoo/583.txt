I just want to say something and I hope it helps everyone. I have seen so many comments on the internet today trying to stop this growing movement. I've seen screen shots on this forum that are outrageously ignorant. Please remember that these people are just that, ignorant.They are ignorant to the truth and magnitude of the way too many have been abused in numerous ways. But some are battling demons that they can't battle alone. There are some that are lashing out at all of us for having the strength to speak up and begin to process of healing. There are others that have watched others be abused and think it is okay to be abused and to abuse. Stand up for yourself and others if you can. If you can't that's fine too. I'm happy that you are reading this and realizing you are not alone. I hope everyone gains a sense togetherness and that this movement doesn't end, but only becomes stronger. When we heal, we too, can help others heal.
