I experienced an acquaintance rape about 6 months ago. I first came up with this song a few months later after my assailant tried to contact me to invite me to go dancing. I flew into a rage and buried myself in my room. In the midst of listening to a lot of Dodie this poem came to me with a half formed melody. I’ve been sitting on it since then, not really sure what to do with it, until the  hashtag appeared on Social Media and I realized it was time to tell my story. I put the finishing touches on it yesterday night and recorded it one go. There are still some rough patches but it’s the first original song I’ve written that I’m proud of and that means a lot to me. The alternate title was going to include the name of my assailant, but considering I still run into them around town all the time, I decided I’m still not ready for any potential backlash I could get for going public, especially on social media. I left a blank instead, both to symbolize the silence around sexual violence, and so that other survivors can also relate to the song. I also left three 8 bar breaks in case any other survivors want to collaborate with instrumentals, percussion, vocals, spoken word, rap. I’d love to produce this as a benefit song for rape crisis centers and support groups, particular for queer and trans* people like myself. Comment or message me if you want to be a part of this project.
