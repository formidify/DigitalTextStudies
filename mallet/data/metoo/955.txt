Hello. I'm a reporter for KCBS/KCAL. We're doing a story about the  campaign and are looking to do an on-camera interview with someone in the L.A. area who's willing to share their story. This issue hits close to home for so many of us and I admire everyone who is speaking out and empowering themselves and others. The story is slated to air today at 5:00 p.m. If you're interested, please send me a direct message. Thank you! - Kandiss
