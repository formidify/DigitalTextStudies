I was eleven when a family friend touched me inappropriately. I am so fortunate that somehow, even at such a young age, I knew to stand up. I told him if he ever came near me again, I would tell my daddy. He knew Daddy and he knew to be afraid of him. I never told Daddy; I only told Mother after the pervert was dead. She asked me why I didn't tell at the time. I told her because I didn't want Daddy to go to jail. She understood. I am blessed; my story is a "non-story" compared to what my sisters have experienced. Maybe, just maybe, Weinstein has at last done something of value for women: His crimes have opened an international dialogue. I care. I stand with my sisters.
