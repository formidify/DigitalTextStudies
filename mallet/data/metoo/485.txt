I have my own story and for a long time, I felt alone in it.  At times, it felt like the only thing keeping me holding on was music.  So, instead of posting a status, I decided to write this song.  If you ever feel alone in what you're going through, just know that you're not.  Sometimes, it can feel like no one is there or cares to be.  That's not the case.  I'm always here for anyone that needs me, don't be afraid to message.If you're reading this, I want you to remember that you have a voice that should be heard, no matter how scared you are.  Please share.
