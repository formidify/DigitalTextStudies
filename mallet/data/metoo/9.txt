I'm glad there is a safe place for us here. I have been keeping my secret for 50 years. It affected me very much, made me feel like I wasn't good enough for a decent guy, I've had 3 failed marriages. Finally had a good marriage but I am a widow now and won't look for anyone else. Too scared. Pretty lonely. My kids and Grandkids don't know and I won't tell them. I am glad to see that young women are not putting up with this.
