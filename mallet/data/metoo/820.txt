I was in foster Care at the age of 3 with a family I though was supposed to keep me safe. Flash forward to 6 years old. I was getting ready for bed one night in my foster mom's room, I went to lay down when my fosterdad came in I thought nothing of it because I was almost asleep and i had school in the morning. He climbed into the bed and turned me around and started touching me down there. It hurt so I told him to stop. He eventually did and said "tell anyone and I'll kill you" his words still make me shiver. Anyways I didnt tell anyone, Because I was scared of someone who was supoosed to keep me safe..... I FINALLY told my dads gf in 7th grade on the way to school, It felt weird but Ive already held it in for so long. I told my older brother when i was 16 he said he didnt believe me and that i was just looking for attention. Ever since then we havent really been close like we used to be in fostercare. Thats when all the counseling started which didnt help at all. My dad took me to this place that was an investigation place i think? There was rooms with the 2 way mirrors which freaked me out so we left.  Its been 14 years and im still sitting here asking My self why I didn't go through with this sooner. Do you guys know a way i can get over my fear of reporting him? I know it needs to be done but im sooooo beyond scared nothing is gonna happen... thank you ‚ù§  #ibelieveyou and thank you for the add
