First of all: I am lucky to say that I never have experienced sexual abuse myself. But still this issue is of great importance to me.I am quite upset, disappointed and sad every time I read or hear about this disrespect for people and this horrible attack against peoples dignity, destroying their self esteem and giving them lots of health problems like anxiety, depression and in worst case post-traumatic stress disorder.I have been working as a therapist for many years and I have met several women telling about their bad experiences with sexual abuse and every time I feel humble that they open the door for me to this often very difficult subject to talk about and even filled with shame even that we know that they never have guilt or responsibility for what happened. And every time I hear these nice, honest, caring women being a far to strong and hard judge against themselves inside I am thinking: This is so unfair and I am always trying to make them be more kind to their soul and heart cause thats the medicine they need and deserve....so I am full of respect for you all, men and women who have such horrible story and even have been sharing it at this site.Actually I have recently made a new song about sexual abuse called «Let there be light» where I am trying to describe the nerve of the feelings and thoughts going through a victim's mind from hopelessness and despair to step by step regaining hope and faith for the future also offcourse depending on support and understanding from people around them.I want to make a musicvideo next year with this song combined with dance and some acting illustrating my song.I will later on publish my lyrics on this site.To all of you: I wish you a good day filled with hope, light and strenght ❤
