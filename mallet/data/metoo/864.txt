I stopped hiding and decided to share my story.. I hope it will help others. **Shortened version of my story..I was molested from the time I was 4 until 8 by my oldest brother. My mom walked in on it (he threatened me if I ever told anyone) she kept it a secret and told me not to tell anyone. And any time it happened to come to her. She'd talk to him, he'd ignore me for a few days and then it'd start over. I'd wake up in the middle of the night to him touching me.. like he thought if he did it while I slept I wouldn't say anything. It took me a long time to realize it wasn't my fault. Even tho I didn't know much.. I was a freaking kid! My brother recently got off probation and I've had to be around him a bit lately. When he's near my nieces, my nephew and my son's, I cringe! I wouldn't say I'm past it by any means. But I've learned to share my story. To not hide. To not feel bad for him or his situation. To not protect him or my mom anymore. I needed protecting and I never got it.Later on, I found out I was not his only victim. I wish I could find those girls.
