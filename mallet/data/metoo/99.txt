I'm sad to say that joining this group and posting and reading has plunged me into a deep state of depression. I am overwhelmed by the number of others who have stories like mine. I am deeply saddened by the worldwide extense of this horror. Therefore I regret to share I am leaving the group. I am ok, but the daily posts I see....I just can't do it anymore. I love you all,  and wish you much peace and happiness.  But I must look after my own emotional state right now. Thank you for sharing. I deeply admire your strength and courage. Xoxo
