When I was on my way to the supermarket to buy sweets, I was persecuted by a older man. Naive like I was, I talked back when he started to talk to me.Immediately I noticed that something was wrong. He had very strong opinions about his rights here in Sweden, I was silent all the time and just nodded. Eventually, I picked up the phone to send a text to my boyfriend, but I was told to put it down.He asked me if I was a racist, and I just shook my head. I then went to my contact list without looking down at the phone, and called my boyfriend. I left the phone call going on, and my boyfriend heard quite soon that something was wrong.When we almost had arrived, he stopped me. He wanted to have sex with me, or to quote him: make love to me. No one else needed to know.I panicked. He approached me and we’re on his way to grab me, just then I saw my boyfriend on his bicycle. I ran to him, and the man quickly started to walk away.3 months later we sat in the trial. He was sentenced and paid damages of 5,000: -. Throughout the summer, I was paranoid, and isolated myself.Over the years I have also been with boyfriends who took advantage of me and in some cases, raped me.Men who have looked at my breasts, asked how much I cost, messages that they want sex with me. I have been called a whore when I said no.The list can be very long ... why is it like this?We are never alone, and I'm sure many people can relate to what I've written. We are strong!❤️Never forget that.
