My stories are long but a year ago I wrote to one of my abusers! He never answered back via messenger. So I started to get angry & wrote a few more messages but he did contact my Mum & asked what I was going on about! About a month ago a photo came up of me I was around 5 from a family member & he & I were tagged in it! I wrote to my cousin requesting the photo be taken down. She asked why & I told her! I had my own family attacking me for bringing up what happened when I was a child! Two of his own children(my cousins that I have never met) contacted me via FB & said that they support me 100%❤️ They have not spoken or seen him for years for the safety of their children. He contacted me via FB & says he is sorry "if" he had hurt me but he can't "recall" it! He then asked that if we talk through FB could it just be between us!  Almost the secretcy  he wanted when I was little. He wanted me to call him or he call so that we could talk. I have left it for now as I am not ready. But with me letting him know that I have not forgotten & I feel I have made the family be aware of the rest of the little ones around him don't be harmed! Also I have been going through issues of an assault which happened when I was 15years old & unconscious in an ambulance & woke to the ambulance worker sexually abusing me. My life I have too always thought I was the guilty one but in the past few years I have wanted to face all of this! And I will & they can have all of the suffering I have endured. People on here have asked why we come out later in life. I was scared when I was little & when I spoke it was to be swept under the carpet!  No more. These were not the only ones but one person has passed & there is nothing I can do. Any ways be strong Ladies & GentlemenDon't be ashamed to speak about it. Be strong & proud & stand tall.   is 💪🏽👍🏼
