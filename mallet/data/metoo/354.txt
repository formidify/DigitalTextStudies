 So I am a man but get sexually harassed, assaulted and raped. I was 15. I played basketball and it was a boy in my group. In that particular season from the first training on he started it. Every training and game day it happened. My parents and his’s were good friends and there where times that I had to sleep over with him. So even there it happened. He was taller and bigger then me so I was powerless. I couldn’t resist his strength. Every time it got worser and worser. It was at the end of the season it stopped. Still at this day I have problems with it.
