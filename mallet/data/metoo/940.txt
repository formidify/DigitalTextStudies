:I was molested at the age of 6 when I could hardly differentiate between a friendly touch and an over friendly one. Also, because the perpetrator was a father figure and somebody I completely trusted, it took me long to understand the act. The molestation continued till 4 years when I finally decided to tell a female family member who asked me not to mention the incident to anyone ever and 'thanked God that I was "only molested" and not raped.' As, I'm writing this, I feel cowardly and cringe at the idea of people reading it and judging me. I wish I could say I have moved on from this 'just molestation' and how it made me stronger. But, it didn't. I'm still not over it and I still don't want to talk about this painful personal episode. The incident left me so scarred that every time I see a kid alone with a chachu, nanu, mamu or papa, I’m scared. But, sometimes it becomes your responsibility to come forward and share it. It's my way of telling women that you aren't alone. We’re all in it and it’s high time we put a stop to it so that no other young girl has to ever go through this nightmare!
