I am a victim of 3 different encounters. One only received justice and only doing 5 years when there was 17 victims. The other two got away and one lives around same area. I take everyday with gratitude though. I will not allow anyone to tear my life or myself apart. I am strong! Today I make the choice to protect myself and carry my head held high. I am not ashamed for this was my unwilling .  shall I never look back & remind myself it's okay that this happened & that I did overcome this! I am a victim of child trafficking and rape but do not live as a victim I live as a warrior ‚ù§
