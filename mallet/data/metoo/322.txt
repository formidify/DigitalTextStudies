I think one of my biggest struggles for my life is the guilt I carry when my child (7 years old) was at a church function and was molested by the Bishop's 27 year old son.   I saw the "known molester of children that no one ever reported to police" around her -- I got this GUT INSTINCT to go get her.  But the "Christian" brainwash I had been programmed with at that time told me "NO... he has been forgiven of his sins and it's been two years -- so don't make a scene".    On the way home that night she told me she had something to tell me.   When she told me he pulled her into a room at the church and put his hands all over her -- I felt SICK.   I DIDN'T LISTEN !!!   Needless to say -- he messed with wrong kid because he was arrested the next day/ spent ONLY ONE night in jail.   Mommy and Daddy got their 27 year old son OFF with just 2 years probation.   I made sure the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints excommunicated him (which should have been done after the 1st child he touched).   BUT -- 5 years later the LDS church allowed him to be re-baptized even though I sent a strong letter of protest.   Then I understand a few years later -- he was arrested again for molesting.   The charge that he faced for my daughter was "Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor"  (REALLY?) but the next time it was as a sexual predator.   I struggle with forgiving myself for not acting on my INSTINCT instead of my religious upbringing.
