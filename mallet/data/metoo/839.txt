Thank you guys so much for your stories. You guys strengthen me. My name is Holley Noelle Robison. I hail from Utah. I cant tell you how old I was, I cant remember most of my childhood before age 13. But I was raped by my cousin. I tried to tell my Dad, but he didn't believe me. I didnt tell anyone else till I was 19 years old.I started becoming an advocate for other's when I became an author of the book "The Gift of a Friend" It's not a New York's bestseller (Mainly cause it's available for free on my site holleynoellerobison.com) but I've had 23 people come to me to tell me that they were abused and hadn't told anyone about it but me. Their stories stregthened me and made me more vocal. I had a man come to me the other day and tell me he was raped by a woman and tried to tell the police but wasnt believed. I'm still visibly angry every time I think about it. But when someone confides in you like that, you can't back down. I remember I was 14 and Mariska Hargitay came out with the Joyful Heart foundation and she had similiar experiences (Although on a much bigger scale) of people telling her their story. She said the same thing.Seeing these  stories today just makes me sad, but also quite proud. Cause a few of the people who have confided in me, have come out with their story. Something they thought they could never do. I share all this cause I know there is strength in numbers. I also know how hard it is to open your mouth and say something. I told my Bishop first, and it was another year before I said anything else, to anyone. If you need me to be your voice, I will be. If you need someone to talk to, I am here. In December, I am running a charity Event in Utah, if you're in the area. If not, we will be livestreaming it as well.I love you guys, and be strong. You are loved.
