Without the outpourings of millions of women through    male victims would simply not have space to raise their concerns and have them acknowledged too.  It's a valuable knock on effect that cannot devalue anyone's pain regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The fact that so many men are posting  into a public space is amazing. There is a danger in a single story and men more than most are silenced from inside and out. So let's accept that there is a lot of pain out there amongst us men and embrace our sisters in the true spirit of  who have given us the guts to speak out as well.
