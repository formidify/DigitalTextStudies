Just something to think about the RAPE CULTURE: In the underdeveloped, absurdly corrupt and highly violent country in which I live - Brazil - we have a movement called FOR THE END OF THE RAPE CULTURE. This "rape culture" - as seen in ALL stories shared in this FB group - is slowly being acknowledged by the scientific community as the greatest menace of the future of the Human species.According to the UNITED NATIONS Development Programme Human Development Reports (HDR) of 2016, "GENDER INEQUALITY REMAINS A MAJOR BARRIER TO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT". Girls and women have made major strides since 1990, but they have not yet gained gender equity. The disadvantages facing women and girls are a major source of inequality. All too often, women and girls are discriminated against in health, education, political representation, labour market, etc.â€”with negative consequences for development of their capabilities and their freedom of choice.
