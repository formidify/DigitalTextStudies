I`m writing this on behalf of my daughter Michelle.Michelle struggeled with anxiety much of her life.When she was around 16 she got a boyfriend who was abusive and manipulative (wich i found out much later).She continued to struggle with anxiety,but managed to get a job in sales,wich she did well.In 2014 when she was 22,she was brutaly raped.This made her loose all faith in humanity,and i don`t think she ever felt safe again,anywhere.She started showing sign of schizofrenia and paranoia.In 2016 she was commited to a mental hospital,and 30. of March this year,she took her own life.I am sharing this because i hope to maybe get some of my fellow men to think about how they treat woman.Just think if it was your daughter,would you want someone to treat her this way?!
