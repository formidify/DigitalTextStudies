I got out of a almost year long abusive relationship August of last year. In January I was at a party and that guy was there. We both drank, him more then me. He was completely plastered. We made out in the hall way. And I was confused, as he just kind of cut me off knew I was still hooked on him. and now this. He went into the bathroom, I followed.“Why did you kiss me?”He pulled me in and we continued. He asked me to mess with him. I said “were at a party..” he said “So?” I said fine...for a minute. So I did. When I had for about a minute or two, I looked at him and sad that’s it..I can’t do this. He said “nah let’s fuck”I said no.He said...and these words still ring.“To bad.” And he pulled my pants off and entered me. I tried to stand, I said no, I didn’t want to scream so many people were there...I was embarrassed. He just pushed me down. Afterwards he told everyone at the party “I didn’t just rape faith” I was silent the whole time. I talked to police. They told me I was raped.A few months later his best friend came to check on me and started making out with me. I pulled away.He backed me into my room and began to undress me. I said (name) we’re moving fast...He kept going. Without a word. He entered me.I said his name I asked him to stop I said please no.He ignored me.Afterwards he messaged me how great my vagina felt...I didn’t know what to say. He asked if I felt raped. I said yes. A boy last year, bought me a onesie for my birthday. Then told me I owed him. And drove me to a dark parking lot. He made us sit there till I finally gave in and opened my corset so he could snap pictures of me.I told our friends, they contacted him. He deleted the pictures. I haven’t touched the onesie since.
