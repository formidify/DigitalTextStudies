I was about 9 or 10 when my sister's dad raped me. He said he wasn't gonna actually do it and that I would still be a virgin but when i went to the bathroom with my mom and i wiped there was a lot of blood and my mom knew what had happened without saying anything. Neither of us reported him cuz he said that if we did he was gonna kill whoever put him in jail and that CPS was gonna take me from my mom...we were scared of him. My mom finally at last got rid of him when I was 16 but it wasn't till I was 18 when I finally told someone about it and when I did I cried...not only cuz I felt as if it was my fault but also cuz it felt good to finally talk to someone about it. Because of what I went thru as a kid I suffer from depression and PTSD and every now and then have nightmares where my sister's dad is back and is doing the same thing he did. I'm now 22 and still talk to someone about what happened and haven't had a nightmare about it since March or April. Sorry for such a long post I just needed to talk to someone else about what happened.Thanks
