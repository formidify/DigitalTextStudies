Some guy asked me if I read the book “IT” tonight and creepily told me I definitely should read it because of what happens to Beverly in the book... Na... I’m good. Already heard about what happened. Jerk.Of course this happens literally the next day after voicing my experience from 8 1/2 years ago 😐 Rape culture is real my friends and it needs to stop.
