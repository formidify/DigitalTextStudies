Elder cousin on Rakshabandhan, misbehaved right after I tied him a rakhiA random man in the parking lot, when I was 12 and waiting for mom to pull the car out of the parking lotA desperate bastard at office, forver dropping hints and hovering near my seat... He was my boss's beer buddy.. That didn't help a lotA client who suggested I deserved a better salary because of my figure and should work under him... This was at my first jobA date who was too egoistic to accept a No.. And called me selfish as I didnt reciprocate his feelings... So he stalked me, shamed me and scared me...Too many  stories especially in India Cant even count :(
