Thank you for add.I have only recently seen  and thought it was time to come out with my story. I was with my ex boyfriend at the time, my best friend at the time was in the same room. But that didn’t stop him, telling him NO didn’t stop him, telling him that I was a virgin didn’t stop him. I lost my virginity to a rapist and I hate it. It haunts me every day.  It’s been 4 years since the assault. My ex did get arrested but they didn’t do anything.
