That's it! I have finally stood up to people denying what has been happening... Every trauma I have been through, can solely be retracted to denial. Denial of me! I don't know how many times I've been raped or by how many!?But do I need to know? Now that I have stood up for myself, I don't want to be kept in the past! I now have a new family and a fantastic man whom I am proud to call my husband! For once, I now have a life! My life!What to do next  ;)
