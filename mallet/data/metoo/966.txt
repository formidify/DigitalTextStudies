. At work, my employer grabbed me while I was cleaning his rooms. Before that, he told me, that nowadays all women would be prostitutes, this would be normal. I needed the money and no one I told about took me serious. Comments where like: "he did not mean it like that", or "you should not do these kind of jobs"..."but he did not really rape you"...etc. One of those, who told me it was not that cruel, was my boyfriend. (that was not the first time, sth. like that happened to me, but the last time, I was silent bout it)
