Thank you to Ms. Milano and all those that would seek to give voice to them that had their voices stolen. For all the  women of the Denver Metro Area, there is a life changing program I have the humble honor of facilitating for; Victim to Victory. We are here for you. And if not us, someone. There is healing from the atrocities of sexual abuse. I was once a voiceless child victimized repeatedly. Today I stand in the gap for those women who are ready to start a new chapter. #VicSis And yes, MEN as well.
