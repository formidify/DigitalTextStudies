Howdy Y'all,Figured I'd introduce myself and Tell my story.I'm a 30 year old Trans-Man. I've been out since 2009.Back before I came out I was in the Army (2005-2006).I worked in Intelligence. There weren't many "Women" in my Company... let alone my Platoon. That led to lots of inappropriate Talk and Touching during work hours and EVEN more so after hours...During one weekend I was at a party with some Battle Buddies and We were all drinking then the next thing I knew 2 of my "friends" were assaulting me. They both out ranked me and I was was not sober so I felt I had no right to go to my CO.I have not told my Family that this happened to me... I don't know if they will see this or not. But my story needs to be heard... No one ever believes me though when I do tell them so this is taking a lot for me to type this up... :/I do Want to Add that:Now as the Man I am I am Very Careful to Make Sure I Have Consent even in a Long Term Relationship.
