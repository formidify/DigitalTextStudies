I was 8 the first time it happened. I told my mom and she said, "I swear to god if you are lying about this then you are going to be in so much trouble."  I got up the courage to talk to my aunt and was removed from the situation for a while but I was never whole after. I grew up thinking I was the problem. Time and time again my mother would let her friends and boyfriends treat me how they wanted. I thought it was okay because I was a bitch if I said no. Then I was raped in college. I was 19 and my virginity was taken from me by a guy who seemed to think I was his property.  He bragged about it after. I was ashamed so I never did anything.
