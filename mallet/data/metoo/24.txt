When I was working as a paramedic .. I was told I was on a mans world and I would have to deal with all the cat calls... rude comments... dirty movies shown at the station. Then it came to the firemen grabbing me on calls and force kissing me. Then when I was carrying a patient down the stairs he was behind me backing me up .... no... he kept placing his hands on my  rear end. Every time I turned around it was someone doing something. When I went to their captain to complain he said to really think about it cause all the firemen are going to get is a slap on the wrist. What do you think you are going to get?I was told by a Sgt. That I should go home cause he did not want me there. All kinds of filthy jokes... then go work on a patient in a car accident that they put their trust in us to do a physical exam as professionals. I could not believe that the firemen watched porno on shift. This was not a jolly volly fire department but a full time city paid department .... at that time they were all doing itâ€™
