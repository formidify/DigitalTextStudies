My virginity was stolen by a rapist when I was 16 years old. He was 27 and forced himself on me.I regretfully lied and told my dad that I was going to stay at my best friends' house overnight.  Instead, we drove to Minneapolis, (90 minutes away), to see some guys her older brother used to know from their lake house. When the three of us arrived we discovered that he had a couple of his friends over. We partied together for a few hours.  People paired up and then everyone left me alone with him at his house at 3:00 AM. He had seemed nice enough and we had kissed a couple of times that evening.  As soon as my friends drove away, he scooped me up and threw me onto his bed and started undressing me............then I started to panic. I didn't know where they went, where I was, or have a phone number to call (pre-cell phones era).    I begged and pleaded with him to stop. I told him I was a virgin and I was sobbing.  I remember his hands holding my wrists above my head.... and me pleading and crying and then I blacked out. I went somewhere else in my mind I suppose. I think I simply left my body.  This was not an alcohol or drug-induced blackout.  It is a real blessing that I don't remember anything about being raped.  Was I limp, like a dead person?     Did it go on long?            Did I keep screaming?....I don't know.  In the morning, when I awoke he was gone from the bed and I was relieved not to see him. I began to cry when I assembled fractured glimpses of the night before.   He had dressed, made himself breakfast, walked by the bedroom door, and said, "Thanks for the free fun." and then he left.   Over the next few weeks, I cried myself to sleep and worried that I would be pregnant or have AIDs. I never pressed charges, because I didn't want to disgrace my family or myself. I just told myself that I was over it.  Years later, a boyfriend grabbed my wrists and squeezed them while we were having sex. I began screaming (like someone who was being murdered).  I was terrified in that moment....and so was my boyfriend!  I woke the household and neighborhood. I freaked us all out!   I can't remember ever screaming so loud.  Apparently, his grabbing my wrists, triggered a repressed memory from when I had blacked out during the rape.  I guess I really never got over it, maybe I never will. I promised myself that the next man who tried to rape me would be a dead man....If there is ever a next time, I will not blackout. I will fight to the death.
