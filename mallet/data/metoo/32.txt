I have been thinking about justice for these predators.  I will never get justice for what my uncle did.  I was to afraid to come forward until after he past away.  Was feeling kind of sorry for myself about it,  so decided to get creative. My uncle always said if i ran away or if i told anyone, he would kill me, throw my body in the Fraser River where no one would ever find me, and my parents would think i was a bad girl and ran away.I'm pretty sure he was cremated.  So I am going to picture his ashes being spread out near a river.  Then the rain came and washed him into the river, and he was never seen or thought of again.  That I'm still here, and he is just gone.Some of us in this group will never get the justice we deserve, which makes it really hard to move on.  So i figured i needed a way to get justice, even if it is only a dream justice,, and not a reality justice.  I hope all of us get some form of justice, whether real or imagined, so we can eventually move on to be a strong, healed survivor.  Hugs to everyone.
