 I was 12, my attacker was the 16 year old boy who lived next door.  He babysat me and my sisters when my mom and her boyfriend went out.  One day he came into my room where I was playing with my toys, he closed the door and pushed my bed in front of it so I couldn't escape.  He then pinned me down on my bed with his body weight and held my arms down with his hands.  I didn't tell anyone directly for a long time.  I was in 6th grade when it happened and didn't discuss it with anyone till 9th grade.  It messed me up.  I became angry and withdrawn.  My mom ended up committing me to a psych ward for a month and a half in the summer of 1988 (about a month or so after it occurred) because I lashed out at her and my sisters.  I should have said something to her, my dad, or the doctors but I didn't.  I was ashamed.  I finally talked to my mom about it when I was 19.  I told my dad about it several years later after learning he too had been assaulted when he was young.  I don't talk about it regularly and not everyone who knows me knows. The people closest to me know.  I try not to think about it anymore but it is always there just under the surface.  Unfortunately it's just something I had to learn to live with. ðŸ˜ª
