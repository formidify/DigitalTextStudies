I am so sad to read all these posts from people who have suffered from sexual abuse, assault and rape. I have experienced all of these multiple times.   But I am happy that through communities like this, we can realize we are not alone, and that together we can change our mysonigist, patriarchal culture. It won't be easy, but there are things we can do.-If you are comfortable doing so, tell your story to anyone who will listen, and to those who should hear it. Keep telling it. Write it down, publish it, share with others.-Shut down anyone who says "Why didn't you (or she/he) tell someone about this earlier? or "Why didn't you (she/he) call the police? What were you (she)  wearing? -Boycott products/companies or organizations who just don't get it, or somehow promote or accept sexual harassment. I used to by DKNY clothing, but no more after Donna Karen's  comments about women "asking for it" when they wear suggestive clothing. I am going to write a letter to the company to let then know why I am no longer buying their products.-Get to know your state and local politicians. Send them emails, letters or call them to protest any current laws or pending legislation that takes away or limits protections for domestic  abuse, rape or assault. For example, in my home state of Minnesota, I just learned that domestic abuse is NOT a reason  for police officers to be terminated, thanks to specific legislation written by a state representative 10 years ago. -If someone makes you feel  uncomfortable with dirty jokes, pornography, or inappropriate comments of any kind, tell them in no uncertain terms you will not tolerate it. I wish all of you healing, peace and happiness.
