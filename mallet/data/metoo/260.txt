Thanks for being added to this group💐💞🌟TRUST your feelings💚TRUST your memories 💜TRUST a good friend💙Go and find a competent Consulting Center for Women. I forgot what a doctor did to me when I was 14 for 40 (forty!!!) years and then suddenly it all came back as if I was watching a film inside of me. The wonderful women in the Center helped me so much to heal these memories. PLEASE go and get help. Life will be worthwhile living again, I promise. I wish you all the very best from my heart❤️❤️❤️💐👭🌻🌟
