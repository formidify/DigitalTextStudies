#me too - I am done protecting my abusers with silence, so here it goes....I was molested at the age of 15 by a male family member (not blood related, but similar age).  I was a virgin and had not even had my first kiss yet. I was incredibly shy and quiet and had no idea what was happening until it was too late. Luckily, I froze up and he was unable to finish his forced penetration. I felt responsible and guilty for many years and never told my parents. I have also encountered sexual harassment at almost every job I have ever had. I worked in theatre where a Weinstein/Trump type of boss constantly came into the dressing room as women were fitted for bras and various undergarments. He touched my breast, asked me to join him and his girlfriend in a threesome, and berated me for 15 minutes during a staff meeting, telling me that " I had no brain, was not being paid to think, and could be replaced immediately". When I complained to HR, I was laughed at and told that everyone thought it was funny. I also worked for a City, in the public works department, and I had a female boss that made my life a living hell. She called me into her office one day and told me to wear more make-up and dresses to work, while a female co-worker was spared this request, even though she never wore a dress or a stitch of make-up ever. When I complained to HR, my boss denied saying it, so it was my word against hers, and I lost. I never tried to sue anyone, instead I just quit. I truly hope that this #me too movement does bring about change in every type of workplace. I am inspired by the courage of so many women breaking their silence.
