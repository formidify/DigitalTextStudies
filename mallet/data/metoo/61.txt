Babe in the WorldIt started so simplyA smile and a look I was ripe for the takingAnd you certainly tookDown ‘round the cornerI entered your carExiting safetyInto darkness and farTo where you undressed meShaken and tornNo warmth from your kissesI lay frozen and wornI wanted it overJust end this pleasePlease just get this overWhatever this isThe years keep on passing The fear still remains Silence has damned me And stilled me to changeMistakes I have made Pile up by the dozenI am no angelI’m rife with your judgingBut this middle-aged meSees that middle school oneSo small, unprotected So vulnerably youngI was only a child A babe in the woodSo tender and trusting Just trying to be goodA babe in this world That blames the young girls While men of your stature Walk freely and sureBlind to the sightNo care for the painYour forced devastation Leaves lives lived in vainWhile I can’t say for sureThat you are the causeI can’t shake the memoryAnd that gives me pause(With immense love and gratitude to everyone who has come forward in great courage to share their  and #MeAt14 stories and photos.)
