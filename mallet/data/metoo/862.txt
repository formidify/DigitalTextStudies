 A lot of my friends have made  posts today.  This is mine.I was foolish enough to think I was safe and I wasn’t.  Thought I could look after myself and I couldn’t.   You live and learn but that incident has stayed with me.    Looking back on it, I was raped.  I have never actually said that out loud and none of my friends knew until today.So..  Your turn..
