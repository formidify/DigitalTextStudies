I was 7-11 years of age... my own cousin molested me for years. My mind has blocked most of it out. I never told anyone as a child I was ashamed of what he did to me. I couldn't speak out. I finally became a mother and realized how important it is to teach them to speak up so I spoke up and told my family. My mother had no idea and felt horrible l. I hated that and didn't want her to feel guilty in anyway it wasn't her fault. My mom then revealed to me that my cousins father did it to her when she was younger. Like it's in their blood or something sick. I told my grandmother and this was the house it took place at and she acted like she didn't believe me... She kind of brushed it off like no big deal. I have shut her out of my life for that reason. I feel guilty for not speaking out because I found out that my little cousin was molested by him also and if if would have spoke up he wouldn't have had the chance to ever touch her. She still hasn't had the courage to tell the family. I wish she would maybe one day she will be able to over come it and speak out.
