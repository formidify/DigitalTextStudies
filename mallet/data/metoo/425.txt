All the people saying men also get abused or women are also abusers re the "me too" campaign need to brush up on their history. No one is denying what you are saying but the focus of this campaign is women for a very good reason. Rape laws were created to protect men's property and that alone. therefore the history of rape is that it was legal for men to rape either their wives or unmarried women for centuries and that is the culture that has been handed down. There has never been a similar law allowing women to sexually assault. Raping women has been backed up by political power for centuries. This campaign was actually started to fight back about Harvey Weinstein abusing women in Hollywood. It is unfair to make this campaign about men as if women areent allowed to speak out about issues that affect us without putting everyone else first all the time. Would you turn up at a breast cancer event and tell people they are excluding people who have other types of cancer? This is the equivalent of that. It is telling women we are not allowed to centre our own issues and that is very wrong.
