Just amazes me what one endured...I've been raped twice, gone through a sexual harassment experience once at a job...and when I was 12 my stepmom tried accusing me of molesting her 3yr old son (which was untrue)just so she could get me removed from the house and have her perfect little family...it almost worked because I attempted to kill myself...obviously I failed, because I had a few good support ppl in my life...and occasionally still do that keep me going
