When I was in 8th grade, at Christian private school, no less, a classmate came into the classroom I was in. He was one of the "cute guys" there and probably every girl had a crush on him, including me. It was around lunch and I was rummaging around in my locker/backpack. He approached and smiled at me, so I nicely smiled back and went back to what I was doing. He told me he thought I was pretty…which was initially flattering, but he got closer, and I was confused, so I moved to the side and ended up with my back to the lockers. He said,"Don't be so shy, why are you shy all the time?" I told him I wasn't being shy. Then he shoved me against the lockers and pinned my arms. As I struggled and tried to turn away, he tried to forcefully kiss me. "You know you want this," he hissed at me. After I continued to struggle away, he finally released me and said, "Fine, whatever," as he dropped his arms and walked away.  I remember shaking and trying not to cry.  I don't remember what I did after that.I was out of my depth and never reported him to any teachers. It was confusing because this happened in a Christain school and I wasn't sure which way was up. I didn’t even remember this until today and realized it’s been in the back of my head whenever situations of harassment come up. To say the least, this is one of many reasons I'm not in the church anymore.
