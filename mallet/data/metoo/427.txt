I don’t usually share about my past but back in the day it was ignored I was born in 1953 and was molested and abused for years so I left home at 18 which was unheard off. Went through many years of addiction n self loathing. I vowed that when I have children I would tell them I love them all the time. Long story made short..... I’m doing ok
