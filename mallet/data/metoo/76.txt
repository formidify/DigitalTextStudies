I was 35 when my harassment happened.  He thought it was ok to talk about sex in our open floor plan office, describing vaginas.  Asking me and my co-worker if we shaved or waxed.  I looked at her to say something and she didnâ€™t.  So I had to ask her for a private meeting to talk about how inappropriate that conversation was.  In the industry that I worked in is dominated by men.  She brushed it off at first.  But after the co-worker kept on going with the same subject.  I went to the owner.  And he had to take action on both the office mgr and the coworker.  Only the coworker lost his job.  The office mgr never lost theirs. I had to leave the industry because of the situation. I was pretty much blacked balled because I spoke up.
