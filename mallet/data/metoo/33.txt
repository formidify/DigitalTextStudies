Recently started premarital counseling with my love and we were talking about trust when she asked if either of us had been sexually assaulted or violated in any way. He quickly said no. I posted my experience in this group in October, but had never talked about it aloud so you can only imagine the look he gave me. Talking to him with her there made me slightly more comfortable, but also frustrated. I'm happy that he's aware now, but there are still many gaps that I can't even fill in for myself. I normally don't have to try not to think about it...I just don't. Ever since I brought it up now I can't make it go away. I can't shake it and don't know what to do
