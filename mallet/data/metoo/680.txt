I don't see men speaking up about it as them taking the spotlight away from women, because lets face it- when it comes to rape and abuse women have more of a voice. I've met people who had no idea men could be raped. There is more stigma with male abuse than women abuse. So I will selfishly advocate for them, even if I face backlash. Their voices deserve to be heard with all the rest. Let's stop dividing and hating one another, every gender, race, etc deserves to speak out about what happened. We all need to work together as one to bring down those that'd dare try to silence us.
