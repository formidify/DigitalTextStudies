I've been struggling all day with whether to share my story or not. I kept telling myself not to talk about it because that's in the past. I thought if I talked about it people would see me diffrent. I thought people would feel sorry for me and I don't wont their simpathy because I'm a survivor not a victim. But the truth is, those were just lies I kept telling myself in order to forget the pain it brings me. Because every time I think about it tears start forming in my eyes and that knot in my throat forms and gets bigger and bigger. Until this day I can't talk about it because I havnt healed. I still think of the people I would hurt if I told my story and I would rather keep this pain to myself than hurt others if I told my story. .
