 I was 3 years old, living with my grandmother when my uncles and father started to molest me. I can talk about it but I can't show anyone my feelings of how this really has effected my life now that I'm raising two daughters of my own, living in fear everyday. I'm glad to know I don't have to feel so alone here.
