I joined a few days ago and have been reading so many posts...feeling the pain and humiliation of so many.. <3Still I can't find myself to actually text that #.. I don't know why really... I guess I'm scared of the repercussions of doing so.. I agree with many that at times you are even doubful that it even happened like it's a dream..cos all around you life is going on and being a sad ...emo..self harming person is like a trend as well so people see you as attention seeking... It happened to me in my early childhood to teenage years... and most recently last year..a guy I knew and trusted... I was drunk...I don't remember much..makes me feel I bare some of the guilt as well..
