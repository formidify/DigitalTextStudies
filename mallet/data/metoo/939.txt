Those men that hurt us, abused us, took advantage of us... they were just as hurt, abused and taken advantage of when they were kids.Forgive them - forgive all - for our own freedom, not for theirs. They have absolutely no idea that what they're doing is wrong, because they've been raised in an environment that encouraged/conditioned their behaviour.Can we all just pledge to raise sons that will respect the feminine?
