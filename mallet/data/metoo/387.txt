Hi, I'm Ashley, and I am an abuse survivor. I wrote out my  post yesterday. And while I am so sad that so many have been hurt I am thrilled that awareness is being made so we can make real change. I am a writer, and I blog about equality for women and abuse. I've also founded The Courage Conference, an event for survivors, which is happening this weekend (Oct 20-21) in Raleigh, NC and online LIVE (with replay).We have free ticket scholarships available for survivors who want to watch or attend but cannot afford the cost.www.TheCourageConference.com The Courage Conference is a non-denominational event that will offer a judgment-free place for survivors of abuse (and those who love them) to gather and hear inspiring stories from other survivors about moving forward in boldness and healing. The event will also educate pastors and church leaders on the topic of abuse and introduce them to safe practices and resources for their faith community. The Courage Conference offers a unique opportunity to hear from advocates and trained professionals through inspiring keynotes talks, Q&A sessions and workshops in addition to connecting attendees with local and national resources, so you don't have to do this alone.If you'd like to find support and a healing community, I'd like to personally invite you to join us.Scholarship application: www.ashleyeaster.com/scholarship
