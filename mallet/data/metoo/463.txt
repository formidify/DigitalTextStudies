The people who where supposed to be family were the ones who molested me. My older brother did things to me and my little brother for about a year then during the same time frame my brother-in law also molested me on a few occasions. I remember one instance of being asleep and waking up to my stepdad doing something to me but I honestly don't remember what if anything it was so I have never mentioned it as I am not sure. When I finally told my sister what her ex husband did to me she told me  "that I was messed up for letting her be with someone that could do that" when I was 17 her new husband came into my room one night and asked if he could kiss me I told him no and told my mom as soon as she came home she then told my sister who said she could not trust him around me so they moved out and then when they could not make rent on there own moved back in with my mom I told my mom I was moving out she agreed. At 18 i started working construction so constantly get sexually harassed but for some reason words words don't effect me. My husband and I were fighting and he wanted to have sex after me saying no for like 5 min I thought to myself I'm not getting raped so I went along with it after word I told him I didn't want to and he said why did I go along with it honestly I know he thought I was ok with having sex but I wasn't. We are working on us but I dont know
