I was 11......he was my moms boyfriend at the time. She was leaving him because he was abusive and controlling....she went to the store to get some stuff for our road trip....i decided i was going to take a shower well i didnt hear the door because i had music on and it was loud.....he took a blunt metal object and hit me over the head with it.....i blacked out.....i woke up with him on top of me (he was about 500+ pounds)... I tried to scream but nothing came out i was frightened.....i finally told someone when i was 14.....then after there was an investigation going....i learned my little brother who was only 2 at the time had witnessed the whole thing.......my case was dropped because the detective never called us back....
