Not sure Im ready to go in to full detail I was abused sexually from the age 3 till 13 from multiple family members all who I trusted and several friends of family I did not know what was happening was wrong I knew that it hurt me but didn't know that it was wrong I though that's these people loved me and i didn't know any better that this isn't what people do who love you I finally came to my sister and to discover that she was also abused Starting also about age 3 till about 14 by some of the same people she then taught me that it wasn't ok and that i needed to tell some one so we did i was slapped and told it was my fault and the abuse continued year after year i began to think it was my fault and that I deserved because i wasn't a good little girl wasn't till about 14 I met a amazing lady who told me it wasn't and I deserved justice but when my family found out they didn't want me to come forth cause they didn't want their family problems and made sure I couldn't have any contact with the lady after that I was in hospitasl for mental care one after another for flash backs and other issues I think that what hurts the most is knowing that I wasn't worth protecting that they didn't care enough to protect me and only a daily basis sent back with my abuses after they knew what they had been doing to me  In my heart I forgave my parents Do I forgive my abusers Im still not sure I want to cause I don't want hate in My heart and they will have to face God in the end I think I would confront them to let them know the hurt they cause Mentally Physically and Emotionally it will always haunt me affect my life I try not to let it control me but certain smells touch movement small thing bring it all back Im not sure I will ever be able to over come that but I do know that I refuse to let them win I will REMAIN STRONG and I will always protect my children and make sure they know it isn't ok and MOM will always protect them
