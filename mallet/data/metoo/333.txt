I haven't talked to my boyfriend about it yet, but plan to one day. I was crossing an organization on campus and one of the rules was not to mingle with the opposite sex. Towards the end of our time on line, they through a party for us. There was a lot of alcohol. I remember my then best friend and I being way too drunk to make it home and decided to stay because we were cool with the guy that hosted the party. He told us that we could stay in his room. I remember not being able to walk well. I remember that she wasn't as drunk as I was but we drank the same things. I remember falling asleep and him crawling in on the other side of me. I remember screaming out on pain then it being gone. Waking up to no underwear and confused. Blood still there . I couldn't remember it much. My best friend told me that he asked her to scoot over and made room next to me. That we had sex right next to her. I wouldn't have. I was asleep. I was fully dressed when I fell asleep and I was a virgin. I asked him what happened the next morning and he didn't respond. I was blamed by his friends who said that he would never do something like that. I was left out in the dark about other details and it took quite a while for her to tell me what happened that night. I was told that I was overreacting. My older brother told me that if I wasn't there in the first place it wouldn't have happened. I have not addressed the situation further and withdrew from the school. I see how it has caused damage to my current relationship. Honestly I wish it would go away. I wish that I could forget it and all of these thoughts would go away. They don't. I'm not into the whole pity thing, I just need to fix myself and find myself again again. Its just hard man
