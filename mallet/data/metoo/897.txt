My heart goes out to everyone who has suffered. Know that however lonely you may feel, there’s is always someone ready to listen and understand. I was 7 when it happened. Two older neighbor boys. Several different occasions. I didn’t know it was wrong until I was older when I realized why the two never hung around me unless that happened.
