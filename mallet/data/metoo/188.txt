 at 16. Flashbacks of coming in and out of consciousness makes me more confused at how a person becomes so damaged they can do that.I've forgiven him. I know he was clearly more damaged and somebody or something broke him so bad that his clarity didn't exist.I've been able to move forward by doing what seems impossible... Forgiving him. Not by not letting him get the trouble he deserved. By getting him the help he clearly needed and the trouble he deserved to get help from.What he did. Wasn't okay. What he took from me. Isn't okay.What I gave to him after he took and acted so selfishly, raised me up from a victim to a survivor. It's not just a  now. It's a MeSurvived.This may not be doable for every case. Please don't think that one situation is the way for every situation. This is just my story to share.
