I was raped because I am trans/non-binary. My rapist tried to convince me I wasn't trans by raping me. And then I was told by another survivor just today that my gender identity doesn't count as far as documenting abuse goes, that I'm either a male survivor, a female survivor or an intersex survivor.Can I please just be myself? Identify myself how I choose, tell my story how I please? I'm tired of fighting. I shouldn't have to fight back. No survivor should have to fight back.
