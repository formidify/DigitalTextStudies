Why do you defend himWhen he already has armor made of knives.Why do you defend himWhen his tongue shoots arrows And his eyes are like the tightened noose around your neck.Why do you defend himWhen he takes your happiness and sells it to others for less than you are worth.How can you defend himWhen your kindness is used as the welcome mat to his every day.How can you defend himWhen he steals your time like prison and your power like a hurricane. When will you stop defending himWhen he’s taken what is left of the only bit you have to offer?When will you stop defending himWhen your children no longer recognize the parent they were born to? Why do you defend himDo you not know that he’s no good for you? #domesticviolence #domesticrape
