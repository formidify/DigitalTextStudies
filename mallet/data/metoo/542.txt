I was sexually abused by my grandfather when I was three. Some stuff I remember and some I don't...I will never be the same..emotionally I am messed up..due to this I have problems showing emotion and I have problems loving. Each day I try to get through this but it's a challenge. I attended a free retreat that showed me ways to cope and find healing❤️
