There has been multiple occasions where I have been sexually assulted. A couple have happened within the last year and a half. I was also sexually assulted by my step father when I was a child. The assult began around the age of 8, maybe even before, and it didn't end until I was 13. This was something I went through on a daily basis as did my younger sister. It took me 15 years to finally come out to my sister about it.I always had a feeling my step-father was hurting her and I learned that to be true. We both came out to our mother shortly after and she took her husband's side. My sister and I lost out mother, brothers, and half our family. We were dragged through court for two years, harressed by family members, friends of family, and peers. He was facing 7 felony charges and took a plea. He is now sitting in country jail for a year, on probation, and will be on the sex offenders list for life. The fight was hell, one of the worst things I've have to go through. I had to dig up memories I've been burring for 15 years.  Even after all that, there are still details I have kept locked away, things I'll never be able to say out loud. I have trouble talking about what happened, even when I was testifying, I was very vague. I constantly think back and wonder if the fight was even worth it because of how much I lost. Being drug through the court process sucked but I'm glad I came out about it. Even though I lost a lot of family, I still had  some who were there every step of the way. I had amazing friends and most importantly I had my sister. She was beyond strong and was what kept me fighting!❤️ He didn't get the convection he deserved but my sister and I got our stories out there and he was seen for what he truly is.Don't be afraid to open your about what happened to you! It's such a huge relief to get it off your chest and it's a big step in helping you heal! So share your story, help other people share theirs! We need to be heard! ❤️
