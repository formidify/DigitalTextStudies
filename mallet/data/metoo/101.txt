This movement is unstoppable... So sad to see that most of the incidents of abuse/harrasment have been perpetrated by those who were supposed to love us and protect us... In my case, a relative who offered an employment. I was harrased by him constantly. I remember how uncomfortable and dirty it all made me feel. Remarks about my body and what he'd like to do to me were a common occurence. I was around 21 at the time and so naive. I remember thinking "this is what I must endure, I am a woman". Let us spread this message so that our daughters never have to think that!!!
