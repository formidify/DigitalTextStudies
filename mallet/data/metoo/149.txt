I feel ready. I've been contemplating it for a few days, and I think I'm ready to stop making excuses, and ready to stop justifying what happened.I was 10 years old my first experience with sex. With a 16 year old boy who forced me and his two little sisters to touch him in the closet of my friends bedroom.13 years old, and my father comes home from prison. I didn't know why he was there, only that he was. From 13 til I moved out at 22 he'd always try and "catch" me naked. Knocking on my door then immediately opening it. Never waiting for me to respond. Fast forward to New Years Eve 2008, and my then-fiance forces me to tell him of my past experiences as I'm incredibly drunk, then forces me to have sex with him.I justified all of this. I told me self "He was just exploring" or "being a boy"... I justified my fathers actions because he was just old and senile... and my ex just wanted what was best for me and to open up...I'm almost 33, and I stand up now and say  and #nomore . None of this is OK. None of this is right.
