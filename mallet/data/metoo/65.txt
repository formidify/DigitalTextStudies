They couldn't hold me down!!!! It's official, in April, I will finally be a published author. My  story about going from depression, anxiety, self harm and PTSD to thriving. Through my journey to emotional and mental freedom from the past pain, I had not slept through the night without a nightmare in 30 years.... finally, after a long, hard journey to health,Now, I haven't had a nightmare in more than a month, and the doctor cleared me to stop taking anxiety medication. I haven't self-harmed since July 4th. The abuse that lasted from ages 9-12 biological father who was the Children's Pastor at our large church - He committed suicide after the story became public when I was 13. The abusive marriages, the date rape later in life has now become my victory story, not the pain lurking in the shadows over my head. My abusers may have written the chapter in my past, but they do not get to write my ending. We are empowered. My  story is becoming my #neveragain decree. Stay strong, warriors! I am proud of your fight!
