First of all , thank you for adding me .I am Julin Boruah , a male from Guwahati Assam India . After going through the posts  I really felt ashamed that males in majority of the places are same brutal abusers .Why it is so ? Why being male always have to destroy the purity of women in such a horrible way..right from childhood to old age ..?We seems to be in a civilized society or world but in reality we are in hell. It's not about harassing or molesting ...it's about psychological disorders from my point of view.Sexual assaults are the biggest sins of one's life who commits it on the weaker section of the society..But I felt strong and good that atleast the respected ladies around the world are opening up strong and bold to fight within themselves to overcome the fear  against molesters , rapists , sexual assaulters etc.Gradually the entire world will be with you all. But general awareness needs to be spread across the globe through seminars , rally's , street plays , drama , concerts , painting competitions , story tellings , dancing competitions ,singing competition, sports , movies social platforms etc ...in the same time .We will do it very soon in our country India. Infact , few things are planned to create awareness within a sort while .am really inspired by the strong and courageous post of yours ....Let's together try to create a healthy and safe atmosphere for women in the places we can reached ....Respect and regards Julin BoruahPresident Nature Care and Tourism Education Foundation ( NGO)Guwahati Assam India
