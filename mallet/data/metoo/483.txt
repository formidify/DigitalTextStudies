Hi I come here without knowledge or relation of this ???????? I don't even know how to describe it.I have never had anything like this happen to me nor any connection to anyone who has as far as I know.I had a perfect childhood,and I'm just a happy person.I raised 4 boys and we are close enough to them that I believe this will not ever become a factor in our lives any time in the future.I guess Ive never really believed this was real.You know like it's real,really just on T.V.,Regardless of of my Morals,past,family,beliefs,etc. IT HAS AND IT'S ALL TOO REAL.I'm afraid,I'm tired;I'm Lonely,I'm confused,Pissed off,Sad,and just about every other slice of negative B.S. emotion /thought that can consume me.I've been dealing with this for almost 7 years.. Most of it spent not even knowing what the hell I was dealing with. The only thing that has kept me fighting is this I am a true one woman man,and I Love my family loyalty persistence and as of late honesty of myself and with myself is mandatory.It's my wife,my friend,my squeak, my leader and my follower,my sister,man Im gonna lose her this whole family is gonna lose her and bigger yet shes gonna lose her family.I will not accept that this shit that this P**** Bi**h A** M***erF**K** did to her 35 yrs.ago can be ruining everything she Loves Today and has been her whole life and then there's me.We grew up a few blocks apart in an isolated small desert town in N.W. Texas No body locks their doors..and We married 61/2 yrs ago,my ex wife left me and our children I raised em.She raised her 2 girls and Im not really sure about timeline how but she  has had to many husbands/relationships . Then me so everything is different with me than all the others. I really think that Im it.Everyone else has run out on her they quit.I would love to say that I never will but the way I feel sometime I just dont know I'm so tired and I thought this was gonna be a walk in the park on the way out life. There is something she needs me to do and I gotta figure out what it is.She trust me and believes in me,Shes smart and knows how I feel.Its been so difficult for her to stay in this relationship she has fought and fought for me like she has for no other.I may be the only one that realizes this,sees this,I;ve given up too much and been tried in to many ways to not take a good look into the beedy eyes of  Sexual assault Rape Molestation I gotta find some answers  I have to.... Im not gonna even reread this and probably no one else will.until one day and then then the whole country will cause Im gonna go see that *********************************************** that did this shit to MY GIRL !!!!!!!!!!!!!
