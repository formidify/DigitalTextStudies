Hope it is all right that I post this poem/short story I wrote here.  It is the only way I think I can share even a small part of what happened to me from birth to age 13. The creepy old man The creepy man was really on his toesHe found me hiding amongst the blackberry rowsHow he found meI'll never knowFor he was such an evil foeHe hunted me like a hound on the scentA rabid wolf with thoughts of hurt and contemptHe was a creepy old fartWith only thoughts of melious in his heartA creepy man with thoughts of hurt and deceitA cool car, with a pedophile on the seatDriving down the peaceful country streetSpreading hatred with his every heartbeatOn tippy toes I would always hideIn no one did I confideIn no one did I trustFor all I could see was mans lustHow I wish I could have let the trust flowBut insteadHeld my hurt so deep belowSo that no one else would knowI felt like a bird in a hurricaneonly on myselfDid I put the blameA spiral down to hurt and shameI need to somehow release all the painLike a raging fireI need to douse the flamedouse the shame, and the blameI am releasing my inner heroMaryOAnd now from herMay I never partDespite all the lies from the mouth of an old fartI have chosen not to take them to heartI have chosen to only see my beauty withinAnd from this beautyMy life can once more beginMaryO
