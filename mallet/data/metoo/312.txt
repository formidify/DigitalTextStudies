Thank you for thisThere were several incidents in my younger life.The last time it happened I was in my late twenties and it was a stranger. I wanted a cigarette so bad I was willing to walk through a trail behind the apartment complex. It was a shortcut to the store.9:00 that night.I randomly think about it.
