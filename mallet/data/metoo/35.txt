Having our experiences minimised or disbelieved is such a big part of the overall problem. Apart from obstructing help and healing it also teaches us to disbelieve and distrust ourselves.  I have recently developed an inflammatory disorder which I was minimising to myself (Oh great another "syndrome" that no-one will take seriously). Did some research and found the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study - very robust, international, large cohort study that definitively shows that sexual abuse and other serious adverse childhood experiences result serious adult health problems beyond the psychological damage (including my stuff).  Showed my doctor and she is now totally onboard. Told my husband and he was completely understanding and sympathetic.  Yay! Sometimes things can go right!!
