for prospective buyers, i would warn of the following: 1) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible, as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable (this applies to earbuds in general,) and 2) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them, that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves.
