i have had the phone for 1 week, the signal quality has been great in the detroit area (suburbs) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky (cincinnati) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75, far superior to at &amp;#38; t's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route.
