the cons aren't really a big deal to me... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files... no folder structure... and it's based on the title of the songs... many of my songs where seperated into folders (on the pc)... and a few had same titles... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i didn't have any that might be the same as another.
