  the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad.

263_3	2.95	it is an extremely cool gizmo.

264_1	2.25	great product.

264_2	0.05	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players.

264_3	0	so then i came across the ipod (10 gb).

264_4	0.6	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one.

264_5	0.2	well i decided to get this one.

264_6	1.8	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket.

264_7	1.95	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player (at that size and the price).

264_8	-0.55	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it, it will be a breeze.

264_9	1.15	enjoy.

265_1	3.25	in a word... amazing i got this for christmas.

265_2	1.2	i was going to get a 10gb ipod, but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com (battery lasts 18 months;  it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99...  what a big improvement... lol) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers, i realized this is a much better buy.

265_3	1.75	not only is it more affordable, but its a better player for windows, which is what i have.

265_4	0	anyway, on with the review.

265_5	0.05	so far i've only had it since christmas, so i cant tell you much about the battery life.

265_6	1.25	it hasnt gone below the second notch (i charge mine whenever i'm at home and not using it), so the battery life seems fine (so far).

265_7	-0.25	software: for the people who complain about software, please, stop complaining.

265_8	1.45	once you hook the thing up to the computer (via the usb cable), the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it's there &amp; installs the drivers.

265_9	0.25	from there, you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player (with the help of the media sniffer... read the manual).

265_10	-1	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags &amp; that takes a while to do if your mp3 files don't have them.

265_11	1	if you're copying cds with windows media, its really simple to give your songs id3 tags, so thats what i do.

265_12	1.95	oh... and file transfers are fast &amp; easy.

265_13	0.05	the player: it's silver.

265_14	0.45	a little weighty (9 ounces... no biggie), but otherwise fine.

265_15	-0.45	people complain about the scroll wheel, but its not a big deal at all (though it is just a little annoying at times).

265_16	1.35	it's easy.

265_17	1.85	the buttons are easy to use, and its easy to navigate.

265_18	1.8	the big backlight makes things easy to see, and the writing is big enough for people to see.

265_19	1.7	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature.

265_20	0.75	you can customize bass, etc.

265_21	0.7	like usual, but also you can customize the sound of the player (like how it would sound in a concert hall, jazz club, etc).

265_22	2.15	its really cool.

265_23	3	sound quality is amazing.

265_24	1.8	i was expecting worse, but its really good (especially if your files have good sound quality).

265_25	1.8	you can also slow a song down &amp; speed it up, which is cool too.

265_26	-2.45	but the earbuds suck!

265_27	0.75	buy new ones asap.

265_28	-0.75	every time you move your face or something they pop out.

265_29	-0.9	for a 250 dollar player, they could have thrown in nice headphones.

265_30	-0.35	a remote would have been cool too... but lets not push it.

265_31	0	oh... one more thing.

265_32	-1.3	i forgot, the case doesn't fit.

265_33	-1.65	my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty, but the case isnt that great.

265_34	-0.7	so far the player froze on me once (i started pushing buttons before it loaded) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that.

265_35	1.25	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button &amp; you're golden.

265_36	1.4	also, you can store data on it, which is a plus.

265_37	1.95	for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod, don't bother, this is a much better buy.

265_38	0.65	hope i helped!

266_1	-1.65	simply doesnt shine.

266_2	0.25	i'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder...  what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox...  based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible (which by hardware standards... they were)...  but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software, the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo...  now we come to the zen xtra...  first i'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good...  the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad (but still rather larger than i had expected)...  what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software.

266_3	-2.65	not just the transfer software (which was a hellishly horrible experience) but also the player's software.

266_4	-2.75	first of all, many actions that the player utilizes don't make sense..  bookmarks for example, are an excellent feature... but not on this player...  rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area, the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made..  this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks...  the dynamic playlists ( now playing ", i belive creative calls it) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate...  well, anyway i could go on and on on why this player didn't meet my expectations...  i'll just say this...  for the average music listener not expecting much... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player...  but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback... i can't recommend this product.
