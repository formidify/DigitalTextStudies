i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash (enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash.
