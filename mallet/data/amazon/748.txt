2) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera (semi-serious amateur photographer)  3) 4x zoom is nice  4) the great thing about digital, in general, is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture, not two weeks later when you get the film developed.
