  i would recommend against using id3v2 tags, and stick with id3v1 only.

295_4	0	hmmmmm....

296_1	0.1	hard disk mp3 players.

296_2	0.05	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod, creative zen, rio karma and iriver ihp - you'll notice that each has their pros and cons; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later.

296_3	-1.55	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed, fault proof, good product support, easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and don't buy yet.

296_4	-0.95	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while.

296_5	-0.15	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now, but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you.

296_6	0.8	ipod clearly has the most buzz.

296_7	2.35	great design and looks cool.

296_9	-1.55	it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents; however, enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can't be used.

296_10	-1.55	some of the more geeky (non-apple type) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface.

296_11	0.65	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery, yet this is the price of sturdy construction.

296_12	1.2	ipod can be used as an external disk, and apparently stores files without problem.

296_13	-1.15	however, the music and data are apparently not separated; ipod reviewers complain about  white noise " in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization.
