  this is the second apex dvd player i've had - and the last.

29_1	2.65	best player for the buck.

29_2	1.95	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd, but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper.

29_3	2.05	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal.

29_4	2.5	loved the slim design.

30_1	-1.5	black and white only after 1 month of use.

30_2	-1.35	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared.

30_3	-2	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy.

31_1	2.6	most bang for the buck.

31_2	3	i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent.

31_3	1.9	it plays all my back-ups, + or -, and everything else i have put in it without a hick up.

31_4	2.9	audio is excellent.

31_5	2.4	well worth the money.

32_1	2.45	for the price, an excellent buy.

32_2	1.3	after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player, i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected.

32_3	0.8	(good going, amazon).

32_4	2.6	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer.

32_5	0.7	so far i've played regular dvd's, backup dvd-r's, mp3 cd's, and regular cd's.

32_6	1.75	i have not yet tried the photo show capability, but i'm thinking that will probably work well too, based on the success with the above mentioned disks.

32_7	0.3	i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit.

32_8	-0.05	the comments i've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance, pushing the button to play pal (european type) movies, when an ntsc (usa type) movie disk is in the disk tray.

32_9	1.25	so, if you read the instructions well, you shouldn't have any problems with this dvd unit.

32_10	0.1	i can't speak to its long-term reliability, as i've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point.

32_11	1.3	but, it seems to work so well now, that i don't anticipate any problems with it.

32_12	2.15	bottom line for me is that for the price i don't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player.

33_1	2.55	excellent second dvd, or first dvd for hdtv ready tv.

33_2	2.6	wow!

33_3	1.4	simple to use and hook up.

33_4	0.3	comes with standard rca jacks for output, along with s-video output (s-video cable not included, must be purchased seperately) and also component video outputs.

33_5	2.1	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used.

33_6	1.65	i also own an  apex ad 1201 " dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago.
