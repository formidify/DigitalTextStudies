  this problem vanished after the first month, so i assume it was a temporary dust issue.

11_10	2.05	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist, and i discovered by accident (it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting.

11_11	-0.4	the remote is okay, but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons.

11_12	1.3	i especially like the more commonly used buttons, such as play, pause, and stop, to be larger and conveniently placed.

11_13	-0.15	while it is true that it will stand on end, it is also easy to knock over that way.

11_14	-1.45	i also didn't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode.

11_15	-0.05	the zoom goes up and down in magnification, which is nice, but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings.

11_16	-1.25	having spent considerable time with professional video gear, i find onscreen displays annoying.

11_17	0	i have not used the progressive scan feature.

11_18	0.55	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine.

11_19	2	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs, mine has run well, and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase.

11_20	-0.4	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor, along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support.

11_21	1.85	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4, i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it.

12_1	-3.3	do not buy this piece of junk.

12_2	-1.45	i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires.

12_3	-2.2	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do.

12_4	-1.35	i can only hear the sound.

12_5	-1.4	i changed video cables, tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help.

12_6	-0.8	i think you get what you pay for stands true.

13_1	-2	nice paperweight.

13_2	-2.15	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd's, after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it's job.

13_3	-2.15	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who doesn't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as (i believe) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked.

13_4	-2	as i emailed to the the customer service department, the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning.

13_5	-2.9	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality, or at least works.

14_1	-3.5	worst piece of electronics i ever bought.

14_2	-2.6	if i could give this a negative rating, i would.

14_3	-2.35	i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems.

14_4	-1.9	won't play a lot of discs.

14_5	-3.05	i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap!

14_6	-1.6	some movies it played yesterday, it won't play today.

14_8	-2.75	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent.

14_9	-2.45	amazon, do your customers a big favor, don't carry this item, and give them refunds!

14_10	-2.95	there should have been a recall on this product.

14_11	-2.55	fair warning - do not buy.

14_12	-2.6	i repeat - don't wast your money.

15_1	-3.1	don't buy!

15_2	-2.7	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work!

15_3	-2.25	it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working.

15_4	-2.25	one stopped working in february and the other in march.

15_5	-0.55	amazon has been working with me to refund my money, but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return.

15_6	-1.2	i have had great experience with amazon, but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems.

16_1	-1.8	we had problems.

16_2	-2.15	the dvd player does not work properly.

16_3	-1.75	the player usually plays dvd's, but has occasional problems such as: 1) not recognizing a dvd 2) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd.

16_4	-1	this has happened with several different dvd's and occasionally if we keep trying something, it will work when it did not work one time before.

16_5	-2.3	after we discovered the problems, we tried to contact apex (fkor 3 months), but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy, and they do not answer their web customer support.

17_1	0.05	ok if you have a 2nd dvd player.

17_2	0	i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now.

17_3	1.55	nothing has broken on it, and it plays all the dvds i have.

17_4	-1.65	unfortunately it can't play all of the dvd.

17_5	0	i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode.

17_6	-1.4	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd.

17_7	0	luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can't.

17_8	-1.75	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 couldn't play all my dvds, and now the player can't play everything.

18_1	-1.8	another person who had problem with picture after one use.

18_2	0.2	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband.

18_3	2.45	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great.

18_4	0.9	even viewed cds full of jpgs.

18_5	-1.2	we didn't get to use it again for over a month (sad, i know).

18_6	-1.75	but when we went to use it again, there was sound but no picture.

18_7	-2.25	we saw reviews that said the same thing, and also saw here that their customer service stinks.

18_8	-0.35	though we were past the deadline for returns (by a few days), i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help.

18_9	0.05	they authorized my late return, and hopefully they are giving apex heck.

18_10	-0.75	i hate apex but love amazon, and i tell everyone.

18_11	-2.8	do not buy this player.

18_12	-1.7	who knows how many uses you'll get out of it before it craps out, but it probably will.

19_1	-1.85	frustrating just hope you never lose / break the remote for this player!

19_2	-2.1	we've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work  apex " dvd players and none worked.
