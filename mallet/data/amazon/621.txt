the plus points are -  1.  price  2.  ability to play most discs - i tried dvd, vcd, dvd-r, audio cd and it played all  3.  good looks  the downside -  1.  the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate, something that you wouldn't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel  2.  remote buttons are small and closely spaced, especially with the menu buttons.
