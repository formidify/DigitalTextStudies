136598840398995_165944657464413,"It has taken me quite a while to be able to tell one thing from my own many experiences about being violated. So many strong people in here have shared their hard stories - so I think I must be strong enough to share just one of mine too... I have experienced many sexistic things in my worklife (which is a main reason why I gave up my work/am not working as an architect today.) Also things in my personal life - which of course are a background and a reason that I have been trapped in these situations.The one experience I choose to tell about here, has haunted me more than any other.I was 21 years old, studying at the School of Architecture in Aarhus in Denmark. For a period I suddently got pain in my back/stomage and also had blood in my urin. When I visited my doctor, and explained to him my problem, he said in a commanding voice: Take off your trousers! And even if I fellt something was wrong, I did what he asked me to. I thought: Well, it has something to do with my underneath... and he is a doctor. He asked me to get in the gynoghological chair, and then he (without gloves) finger-fucked me. When I was starting to cry, holding my arm over my head, he commanded: Look at me! I dont know, why I did it, but I looked at him. It is so shamefull, to tell this. When I got home, I took a long, long very hot bath, crying.After a few days my pains increased, so in the end I couldn't move. I had to call an emergency-doctor, and I begged my boyfriend to stay with me, because I was terrified that the doctor coming, was a man.It was a good doctor, a nice person, who came to see me in big pains. He very quickly gave me the diagnosis, I had a severe infection in my kidney. I got medicine straight away and had to deliver a urin-test. That was all! No trousers off. His diagnosis was right. And in a week I was ok.The other doctor not only harrassed me, he also failed to help me from a seriuosly alarming problem, that could have developed  to something even worse. I told some people around me about it - but only one person reacted - and this was my brother. He followed me to the doctor, when I should give an explanation of why I wanted to changed to another doctor. I am gratefull to him today (have never told him...) But I wonder why other people very close to me didn't react. Today, more than 20 years after this, I I dont like any kind of doctors, even if I choose only women, if possible. I have been seeking the bad doctors name on the internet, in a wish to warn other women. I didnt find it, he probably went to pension now.",Anne Gottlieb,,status,,2018-01-08 17:24:37,21,10,0,7,4,0,1,9,0,0
136598840398995_157628978295981,Just writing this brings tears to my eyes. It’s still so raw to me even if it was two years ago. I was 18 and I started dating this cop I had make at my gas station job after he’d contacted me on Facebook. I’d liked him for so long I couldn’t believe he actually liked me. Whenever we’d text he’d always ask me did I want to ride out with him after duty. I turned him down but I finally said yes one night. We we’re supposed to stay in town but he took me across state lines when we were only supposed to talk. I was hoarse with a bad cold I even left my glasses but he drove me an hour and thirty minutes from home. He was so off that night and he scared me. He looks scary. He got mad at me and took my phone away from me even before we got to that place. He took his truck down a trail in the woods and parked. We’d talked on the way there. We were still supposed to talk but he wanted more. So many questions race d my head. Did he have a gun? Would he kill me? I kissed him at first but then he started to get serious and I didn’t want to. He promised me before we left my house there would be no sex. But he took out a condom and I was speechless and hurt. I froze. He positioned me how he wanted and I was so scared he’d hit me if I said anything. I was a virgin But I thought maybe I should lose it. But no this wasn’t right. I told him to please don’t hurt me and I pushed his shoulders but he forced himself inside of me. I was so small he couldn’t force himself all the way in so I tried to close my legs and I was still pushing him but he told me to open my legs up and I wouldn’t do it. So he threw my arm out of the way and he forced my thighs apart with his knees then he forced himself all the way inside of me. It hurt so bad and I cried and spaced out. I just wanted him to stop hurting me but he wouldn’t. I just wanted to get home I wanted to live. He looked so evil on top of me I closed my eyes until he was done. I was in so much pain I had purple bruises everywhere. He told me nobody would believe me because we dated and he was a white 23 year old cop and I was an 18 year old black girl. He lied and told me he was 21. He had to drive me back home and he had the audacity to ask me was I still his friend. I had purple bruises down my whole spine from him pressing me so hard against the middle compartment. I was so sore down there and there was blood from where he tore my hymen. I crawled in the middle of my bed at 3a.m. crying myself to sleep because I knew I had lost who I was. He would still come to my job and I’d have to hide I would shake so bad. He would follow me through town if he was on duty and saw me driving. He would drive past my house. And I was always scared he’d pull me over late at night and hurt me again or come to my home and rape me or kill my father. I never got justice and now he’s still a cop in another town 45 mins away. He even got an underage girl pregnant and no-one did anything. He hurt so much and he’s still respected. Sorry my story was so long. But thank you.,Daisha Colvin,,status,,2017-12-14 20:50:58,58,31,0,11,9,0,2,33,3,0

136598840398995_166272027431676,"#me too - I am done protecting my abusers with silence, so here it goes....I was molested at the age of 15 by a male family member (not blood related, but similar age).  I was a virgin and had not even had my first kiss yet. I was incredibly shy and quiet and had no idea what was happening until it was too late. Luckily, I froze up and he was unable to finish his forced penetration. I felt responsible and guilty for many years and never told my parents. I have also encountered sexual harassment at almost every job I have ever had. I worked in theatre where a Weinstein/Trump type of boss constantly came into the dressing room as women were fitted for bras and various undergarments. He touched my breast, asked me to join him and his girlfriend in a threesome, and berated me for 15 minutes during a staff meeting, telling me that "" I had no brain, was not being paid to think, and could be replaced immediately"". When I complained to HR, I was laughed at and told that everyone thought it was funny. I also worked for a City, in the public works department, and I had a female boss that made my life a living hell. She called me into her office one day and told me to wear more make-up and dresses to work, while a female co-worker was spared this request, even though she never wore a dress or a stitch of make-up ever. When I complained to HR, my boss denied saying it, so it was my word against hers, and I lost. I never tried to sue anyone, instead I just quit. I truly hope that this #me too movement does bring about change in every type of workplace.

My relationships with men are overwhelmingly positive. Yet, I have experienced my own share of sexual assaults and poor treatment. Here are some of them:-Madrid, Spain 1957 My younger brother and I were being watched by a housemaid when her boyfriend arrived. At one point, while looking at me, he began to touch himself and laugh. He later threw my little brother into the swimming pool and put his foot on his head while laughing and said if I didn’t swim over and save my brother he was going to drown him. I did not know how to swim but was able to dog paddle over and get my brother out of the pool. I don’t know how I did it.- Alcalá de Henares, Spain 1958 while playing in the courtyard of a friend’s house her grandfather picked her up right in front of me, turned her upside down so that her dress fell back, moved her panties and began to lick her vagina with his tongue while laughing.-Almost a total loss of memory for a period running from 1959 to 1962 that was caused by something but I don’t know what.-Fort Worth, Texas 1962 The father of my friend next door tried to pull my pants down and spank me one morning while she and I were watching cartoons at her house.-Mansfield, Texas 1966 A boyfriend tried to force me to have sex with him behind the school but I punched him in the throat and got away. He still passed the rumor around that I had let him do whatever he wanted. -Summer 1969 I witnessed a pre-teen female cousin being sexually assaulted by a well-liked older uncle. I was just a kid. Fortunately, my father and mother believed me when I told them but they didn’t appreciate being told about it. Nothing was ever done to help the girl as far as I know. That same summer while visiting a favorite cousin she advised me that her older brother frequently paid her visits at night and felt of her body. She said she managed to handle it by pretending to be asleep. Since I was staying in her room with her she advised me to do the same if he came in and tried to feel of me. “Just pretend you are sleeping and everything will be okay.” (I told her that if he came and tried to touch me I would break his arm and that I would by no means stay quiet about it.)-Majorca, Spain 1970 My mother and I are sexually assaulted in broad daylight in an area of a public beach by 2 Spanish males who came up to us, began swimming nearby and then sat down on large rocks in front of us, removed their swimsuits and began masturbating and smiling at us.-From 1971 through 1979 First off, I didn’t marry until a few years ago. Back then I was a coed working my way through college. I went on a reasonable number of conventional dates. Most were great experiences. But during that time several dates attempted to force me to have sex with them against my will. All of these guys were seeming nice guys from good families who went to school and/or held down jobs and in every way looked on the outside like normal everyday decent guys. Some were so insistent that they strong-armed me into having sex with them against my will in what is now called “date rape”. -Dallas, Texas 1972-76 Jobs were usually found through the classified ads in town newspapers throughout the U.S. A typical ad regardless of the type of job would read: Office Clerk Wanted. Must type 40 wpm. ONLY Attractive White Female 18-23 years old Height/Weight proportionate need apply.-Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi 1973 I was raped by two unknown men on my way to visit the dorm of a girl friend. It was around 7 pm at night with other people not far away. I was advised not to report it and nothing was ever done about it even though there was a rash of rapes going on at the base during that time.-Richardson, Texas 1979 My postman was delivering the mail in the freezing snow. I had often spoken to him. On this day I had been making bread and had just brewed some tea. I invited him in for a second to have a warm ‘cuppa’ but when I turn to go back to the kitchen he grabbed me a pulled me to him trying to push me to the ground. With my free right hand I grabbed a giant butcher knife and pushed it under his throat. Looking into his eyes I just said: “let’s do this”. He screamed and ran out the door. I tried to report him to the police. They referred me to the Postmaster General. They sent 2 investigators who seemed to be enjoying themselves quite a lot asking me to re-enact what occurred as they challenged me at every turn about why I did what I did etc. I learned later that he was not prosecuted or fired but merely assigned to a different zip code. I also learned from the apartment management that the same postman had assaulted over 7 women in my complex alone.-Dallas, Texas 1979 Right after graduating from university I was starry eyed and optimistic about my future. I approached a company I was particularly interested in working for and set up an interview. But after meeting with the CEO for only a few minutes my prospective employer came around his desk and sat down next to me. He placed his hand on my knee and said I should give up this whole idea of career hunting. He said for the same salary I was asking he would set me up in an apartment, give me a new car and pay me the same amount of money. My face was beet red trying to get back to my car and hold back tears of shame and dismay.-Dallas, Texas 1984 A former college professor of mine gave me a lift to my bank when my car was in the shop. As we rode along talking about ordinary things I happened to look in his direction and saw that he had taken out his penis while driving and was masturbating and smiling at me. I told him he better put that “thing” away before we had a wreck. I managed to get away without further incident by pretending that nothing out of the ordinary had happened. It was very disturbing.-San Antonio, Texas 1992 I was working in sales and renting an apartment from an older man whom I knew through my job. It was a temporary arrangement. I was getting ready to move to Dallas the next day when the man knocked on my door. We often talked so I let him in. But he suddenly grabbed me and threw me to the ground. His strength was amazing. Though I tried hard to fight him off he raped me. I never told anyone about it and got away that very night.I have written about these experiences as way to sort of chronicle what has happened to me over the years in this regard. It is very personal. But I must tell you that there are still some things that have happened to me that I cannot bring myself to share.I firmly believe that was I to have felt empowered to say no from a young age it could have prevented many of my problems with men especially when it comes to the date rape issue.

That I should go home cause he did not want me there. All kinds of filthy jokes... then go work on a patient in a car accident that they put their trust in us to do a physical exam as professionals.

I know I received so much support for my story and I love y'all for that.The not believing problem is especially bad for male victims such as myself. I have listened to so many men and women say that men can't be victims. I can't say I've ever heard of a case where people actually believed the man off the bat. Recently in one of my CJ classes, I said "" he or she"" in regards to sex crime victims and a woman blatantly said that men can't be victims. Her reasoning was that men always enjoy it when a woman forces herself on him and that it be can't be rape since the woman has to use a tool to threaten and overpower. Obviously, this really upset me, I cried in front of my class and mentor as I argued.A few weeks prior at my campus a male student was groped and no one believed him. So many people called him a liar and said it was for attention. I felt so bad for him and backed him every chance I got.During the summer at work, I wore shorts(I work outside and was within dress code) for the first time and two female coworkers started touching my legs all over, above and below the knees without consent. I got upset and they were baffled on why I reacted like that. I told a male coworker and he said that I should've enjoyed it because they were 'attracted' to me. This has been eating at me for awhile and I just wanted to get it off my chest.",John Jaksik,,status,,2017-12-15 20:56:25,37,17,0,14,8,0,1,14,0,0

136598840398995_157670494958496,"It happened to me when I was 18. I came from a steady history of emotional abuse from my peers, occasionally physical as well, and from a history of neglect by my family. I was the youngest of four kids, and all three of my siblings were over achievers. (Since then my family and I have grown very close and the once broken relationship I had with my parents has been mended and is stronger than ever)I wont bog this down with the details of my childhood. All that's essential to take away is that it broke me down. I had no self confidence, a fear of men, and of people being physically close to me. I never felt good enough, had a problem with rage, and had a lot of emotional baggage with nowhere to put it all. The only relief I had was my one best friend.If there's one thing I've heard, it's that a predator knows how to spot prey. I was weak, insecure, vulnerable and despite my best efforts i know it showed. It was winter when i met my abuser. At first it was all innocent. We were just friends. But as the friendship progressed he utilized many methods to isolate me and force me to become reliant on him. I will never forget the time i told a white lie because i didnt want to hang out. I had an issue with telling people no then, because i had never known a time where my opinions and desires mattered. His response to the lie was to tell me that if i ever lied to him again about anything, we couldnt be friends. thats how it was with him. All or nothing. He knew how to press every button in my book. And i let him. i was depressed, alone, the man i loved had just told me he couldnt be with me...by then, my abuser had spent MONTHS wearing me down trying to be my boyfriend. It was constant, and never ending. Id told him no so many times i lost count. But when my love (who is now my husband) told me no, i broke. I gave in. I told my abuser yes. His response was to pick me up then and there, carry me to my own car after taking my keys from me, and screw me in the back seat...Some of my friends came out and started to rock the car like it was a joke. I was so shattered and in shock that he picked me up, i couldnt find my voice to say no. I just took it...Barely a month later, he left me after i was intentionally the worst girlfriend i could be to get him to stop trying to be in a relationship with me. My methods worked, but he knew what id been trying to do. He started saying id regret not being with him. He chewed into every shred of self confidence id managed to get. I entered a depression so bad, i almost flunked out of college. it got worse. A few months after we split up, he contacted me via skype to tell me he was suicidal and going to kill himself. I rushed over there to stop him, and found him just....standing in the driveway. Waiting for me. He didnt look depressed, or upset to the point of death. I didn't care though. I was just so glad he hadnt done it. I went inside with him. We went to his room. He offered me a drink. I was so relieved he hadnt killed himself, i wanted something to settle my nerves. Next thing i know, hes joking about how i cant finish off the bottle of Southern comfort he had. I take the bet. I drink the drink. Then im waking up in my car, at the parking lot by the beach. My mother is screaming at us. I dont know how we got there. All i know is that she tracked me with my GPS. He drives me home. My mother is still screaming at me. Now shes called me a drunk whore...That breaks me. I start to cry. I cry into my sisters arms for an hour and then she goes to bed. Im still drunk, and ripped up inside. So i went back downstairs looking for comfort from my friend.I am a suggestable drunk. I mimic whatever emotions someone puts forward to me...he knows this. He starts out small. Touching my face, my arm...and then like a switch flipping it gets sexual. This part is still hazy as i was sobering up. I remember being on the floor of my parents living room, and hes having his way with me...just like that...And at the end he asks if im on birth control. like an after thought. It didnt matter. I could only nod and say nothing. It was like a splash of ice water to the face. I was awake. I was sober. I was in shock. I picked up my clothes and went to bed.The next morning he goes home with my mom driving him. I contacted him later on facebook. I asked him why he did that. Id told him for months i didnt want to be with him. we'd split up. He said it wasnt his fault. He ""memory tested me."" Because i could remember what hed said a minute prior i was sober enough to consent....He made me believe it was all my fault, and so i buried the memory...years later he went back to jail for parole violation. Hed done to a little girl EXACTLY what hed done to me with the alcohol. He broke his parole to throw me a birthday party. His going to jail was the best thing that ever happened to me. While he was gone, my love came back to me. He told me he realized how stupid he had been, and told me he missed me, loved me, and never wanted to let me go again. He proposed to me not even three months later, on christmas eve. I remember going to the jail to show my abuser my fiance, and the ring. He sent me back a letter trying to convince me i was making a huge mistake. (8 years later, still going strong in our relationship.)Years later, while he was gone, i mentioned what happened to me to a friend, and he said that was rape. I remember being in denial about it. Denial was easier...The next year i went insane. I fell apart. I lost all my friends, withdrew into isolation and manic depression. Crying jags, exhaustion, paranoia, pain...So much pain. But my husband held my hand and walked with me through every mountain and valley of recovery. Im still not all better. I may never be. I know i will never be the person i was before, but thats ok. I didnt like that person anyway. I am stronger now. Wiser. I will never be fooled like that again. I will never be harmed like that again. And no matter what, i know i will have my rock, my husband and soul mate, by my side. I couldnt have gotten as far as i have without him. My husband gave me the courage to walk away from this toxic person, and every day i treasure what he has given me. Hes helped me recover my confidence, my dignity, and my power. I will never be anything other than the best that i can be.",Rebecca Dugard,,status,,2017-12-15 20:55:50,5,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,0
136598840398995_156404468418432,"I have been thinking about justice for these predators.  I will never get justice for what my uncle did.  I was to afraid to come forward until after he past away.  Was feeling kind of sorry for myself about it,  so decided to get creative. My uncle always said if i ran away or if i told anyone, he would kill me, throw my body in the Fraser River where no one would ever find me, and my parents would think i was a bad girl and ran away.I'm pretty sure he was cremated.  So I am going to picture his ashes being spread out near a river.  Then the rain came and washed him into the river, and he was never seen or thought of again.  That I'm still here, and he is just gone.Some of us in this group will never get the justice we deserve, which makes it really hard to move on.  So i figured i needed a way to get justice, even if it is only a dream justice,, and not a reality justice.  I hope all of us get some form of justice, whether real or imagined, so we can eventually move on to be a strong, healed survivor.  Hugs to everyone.

136598840398995_155808115144734,"I have attempted to document and write about this experience numerous times and have always halted because of either shame or not hurting family members that were victims as was I.But the current time period has overwhelmed my hesitations and I am prompted to share this experience.I write this now not for attention but in the hope that this will be a step towards healing. I have spoken with numerous therapists and have gone periods without any thought of this experience. Somehow like a beautiful lawn, the experience pops up just like a weed and that weed needs to be pulled out before it overtakes the beauty of the well manicured, watered lawn. So I purge my current experience of this past event by documenting this experience hoping that this will help someone and myself. I was a child that was overlooked by adults for lots of reasons, the purpose of this isn’t to talk about my family structure but to express something that is way too common in our society. My sexual abuse started when I was 8 years old, I thought it started when I was 12 but I had an experience as an adult during intercourse and I realized what I originally thought was occurring (him rubbing my child body up and down on him until he ejaculated, without penetration) was something my brain created to protect me in some weird way. I was born in NYC, but raised by my mothers parents from 2-3 months old until I was 4 years old in South America. I was sent back to the US when I was 4 and raised by my dad and my mothers family until I was 12. My mother and I had a very distant relationship for lots of reasons, she blessed me with her intelligence and ability to learn anything I put my mind towards and I am forever grateful for the genes.Both of my parents worked hard attempting to realize the America dream like most immigrants do. I was always perceived as an intelligent, but difficult, and different child that would say whatever crossed my brain without regard to how it may effect whom ever was on the receiving end.In the fourth grade my standardized tests scores were “12 grade and beyond “ and I was sent to the first magnet school in Manhattan.By the time this was occurring my life had already taken a change of course.My sisters husband was a child predator. He took a liking to me from an early age and would give me money originally for no reason at all. He would often compare her to me even though she was 16 years my senior and he was 10 years older than her. I recall him saying things to her like “why can’t you be like...”.  He changed my life forever. The sexual abuse started when I was 8 years old (in the 3rd grade), and continued until I was 14 years old ( in the 9th grade). The first time I spoke about it was when I was 12 years old, someone in my family was getting married and I chose my closest older family member who was 21 or 22 years old at the time to lay this heavy confession upon ( I had told my younger sister because we were friends but she was only 9 years old and I was concerned he might do the same to her and even though I was a kid, I wanted to protect her) Being a child without any real knowledge besides what I read in books I somehow thought I could be pregnant, if this wasn’t a concern,  I don’t know if I would of told her but I did. Her response was “did you miss your period?” My reply “no”, her response “ok, let me know if you do “. Later on that year I attempted to kill myself taking all of the prescription drugs I could get my hands on at that time. After my attempted suicide, every one in my household just thought I just wanted attention within the next year the brownstone I lived became a tragedy related to an electrical fire, one family member died, another child was injured, and my father became permanently disabled. My sisters husband insisted that I go live with him and my sister which I did. At 14 years old I became pregnant with my sisters husbands child. I was now in high school and had cultivated a friendship with an individual I am still friends with today. We learned about Planned Parenthood together and I had my first abortion at 14 years old while I was 24 weeks pregnant with her as my support system. After that experience  I started running away from home. I refused to be subjugated to an environment I had no control over. I am currently in my early 40’s, I have heard of many situations where this same predator has taken advantage of women with young girl children who he abused, there is only one situation I know of where he actually abused his own daughter..... all of these cases occurred after me and I bear a guilt related to not being brave enough to call attention to the authorities in order to identify him for who and what he is..... He is one of the lowest forms of humans that walks our planet.... someone who preys upon the weakest members of society deserves to be known for what they are.... they should not be cloaked, hidden, or given rights like all upstanding members of society, there should be no rock under which they can hid, they have taken away the essence of youth and childhood innocence that isn’t a privilege but a right.He deserves to have his right of  anonymity taken away, THE WORLD should know what he has done and he should be treated in the same manner if not worse .....He who have violated CHILDREN and Women...",OZ J Thomas,,status,,2017-12-08 20:22:21,16,9,0,7,7,1,1,0,0,0

Well, it basically triggered me and outraged me that not only did he seem  have had a healthy, ""normal"" life, ( he was  deputy sherriff), so i got on his Facebook wall and ousted him, much to the disgust and disbelief of his family, especially his adult daughter and ""best friend!""

136598840398995_150569179001961,"A conversation with my rapist...January 19, 1989. I was 19 and a sophomore in college. I was a young sophomore because I started college at 17, but I was independent, fearless and didn’t care whether people liked me, my hair or my clothes. I didn’t blend in and I wasn’t a follower. My personality was not much different than it is now- opinionated, stubborn and at times, a little defiant.It was drizzling, and I was rushing to get to my lunch date with my boyfriend, who, in perfect nerd fashion, had formally asked me to be his girlfriend the previous day. I hurried past a group of guys hanging out in the quad -the center of campus situated between four academic buildings- which included the campus bully, an intimidating football player and member of a popular fraternity. I often went out of my way to avoid him. He was loud, obnoxious and never passed up an opportunity to humiliate someone. This day was no different. As I passed him and his fraternity brothers, I did a generic, all-inclusive wave and tried to make it clear that I was on a mission. Destination: Jones Hall, the cafeteria where my boyfriend was waiting. I was almost in the clear, when I heard my name, “FRAN!” It was him. Yelling for me to come back, demanding to know why I was in such a hurry and what was more important than acknowledging him in a “proper, respectful” way. This was typical behavior for him. I told him I was late meeting my new boyfriend (“mistake” number one), and that I really needed to go. His response was: “Fuck him, he can wait!” I rolled my eyes and started to walk away (“mistake” number two). The guys laughed and he grabbed my arm and said: “You need to learn to be more respectful.” At 5’5” and barely 110 pounds I was no match for him. He was 5’11”, 240 pounds and built like a brick. He picked me up, flung me over his shoulder and started to walk toward his vehicle, which was illegally parked on campus almost daily. As I screamed for him to put me down, the guys continued to laugh and eventually went their separate ways.He threw me into his truck from the driver’s side, and by the time I made it across the passenger seat to the other door, he was driving down the hill. I demanded he stop the truck. He said I had two options: apologize for being disrespectful or jump out of the moving vehicle. I chose neither, and unleashed a profanity-laced tirade insisting that he turn around and return me to campus IMMEDIATELY! My demands were ignored as he drove farther away from campus, lecturing me on how I could have made the situation so much easier by being respectful and simply apologizing. I was unamused, angry and defiant, growing more upset at the thought that my boyfriend was waiting for me, assuming I had stood him up. It’s 1989 and there are no cell phones. I can’t text or call him. Or anyone else.We arrived at an off-campus trailer (I learned later that he lived with a police officer) and I refused to get out of the truck. He reminded me that it’s this same defiant attitude that created this situation in the first place. I ignore him, arms folded, staring straight ahead. He tells me that he needs to go inside to get a few things, promises to return me to campus and strongly suggests that I get out of the truck. I refuse. He walks around to the passenger side and pulls me out, picking me up and cradling me like a baby. He holds me over a large puddle of water, and again demands that I apologize for my “bad attitude.” I respond with, “Go f—— yourself! Put me down, NOW!” He complies and drops me. I’m covered in mud. He laughs, and feeling defeated, I start to cry. For a brief moment I see what appears to be compassion as he helps me up and says: “I’m sorry, I was just messing with you. I don’t want your boyfriend to kick my ass, so come on, and get up. I’ll give you some sweats to change into and I’ll take you back to campus.” I believed him (“mistake” number three). After all, he wasn’t a complete stranger, he was just the campus bully- a jerk, a prankster with a mean streak who targeted both, guys and girls.I stepped into the trailer and he handed me a pair of oversized university sweatpants, a matching sweatshirt and said I could change in the bathroom. I changed, grabbed my pile of wet clothes and as I exited the bathroom, I was face to face with him. I smiled uncomfortably and said “Ok, I’m ready. Let’s go.” He said: “Say thank you.” I smirked and responded sarcastically: “Ooh kaay…thank you.” I’m pretty sure I rolled my eyes (“mistake “ number four). He pinned me against the wall and tried to kiss me. I turned my head and tried to slide past him. He grabbed me, forced me onto the bed, aggressively pulled off my sweatpants and brutality assaulted me. I screamed and begged him to stop, and he told me that I needed to stop playing hard to get and that it would feel better if I didn’t resist. I fought, but lost.How I got back to the truck is unclear. I don’t recall the conversation on the ride back to campus and I don’t remember him escorting me to my dorm room, but there I was…and so was he. My roommate was frantic, worried about where I had been because my boyfriend had come by repeatedly looking for me. As I was about to explain, my rapist interjected and told her that I had been disrespectful and needed to be taught a lesson. I verbally lashed out at him, feeling a sense of safety in the presence of my roommate. I was wrong. He said: “There she goes again. She hasn’t learned anything.” He removed the belt he was wearing, grabbed me like a small child, put me over his knee and struck me on my legs several times. My roommate yelled at him to stop and he laughed, sat me up and as he left our room, pointed at me and said: “Behave yourself.”My boyfriend arrived later and asked what happened to me, why I was a no-show at lunch. I was embarrassed and traumatized, but I told myself that I could never let him know that I had allowed myself to be raped. There were visible marks on my legs from the belt so there was no getting around that. My roommate and I explained that the campus bully (unbeknownst to him, now also a rapist) was responsible. My boyfriend stormed out of the room and I later found out that he had driven to the trailer and confronted my rapist with a baseball bat. The following day I received a call: “Tell your boyfriend that the next time he decides to confront me, he better bring a gun, because I will shoot his ass.”In the months following, my rapist was confident that I hadn’t shared his crime with my boyfriend or anyone else. Not even my roommate. However, as a means of additional “insurance” he initiated a friendship with my boyfriend, which began with an apology for the “spanking incident.” An apology to my boyfriend.We occasionally had superficial interactions with my rapist which finally ended when my rapist graduated and my boyfriend and I broke up. The following year, he graduated and was drafted by the NFL. I continued my education at the university, graduating in 1992.I told myself that their friendship would never last. After all, the threat (me) had been eliminated.A few years after I graduated, my ex-boyfriend and I reconnected as friends. We became Facebook friends and connected on LinkedIn.In 1999, a college classmate shared that my ex-boyfriend and my rapist were business partners. I finally mustered up the courage to tell him what I had kept secret for 10 years. I felt that he deserved to know that he was doing business with a sexual predator. I told him my story and his response was shock and compassion. He was supportive and said that he wished I’d had the courage to tell him when it happened, and then glossed over his business partnership as a onetime investment rather than a long-term relationship. I was relieved.Over the years, I have relived the experience in my mind more times than I can count. In 2016, I called my ex-boyfriend to discuss my need to confront my rapist. He advised against it. It was then that I learned of their continued business and personal relationship. Despite his glowing endorsement of my rapist who had become a family man, attended church and joined him on family vacations, he also expressed concern for my well-being and safety. He reminded me of how well-connected and powerful my rapist was and that he had the ability and the means to “destroy” me.He had quite the resume: From campus bully and rapist to semi-professional football player to CEO to University Board Member. Our university.We continued our discussion via text message as he encouraged me to “heal internally” and expressed concern for what my “allegation” could do to the rapist’s reputation, business and family. The conversation went from “I’m really sorry this happened to you and that it still impacts you” to “after weighing what I know about him today, the conclusion is that it is unprovable and unknowable.” With that, our contact and friendship ended. I was devastated. The one person who was my protector for two and a half years in college and a supportive friend in the years after, was sounding like a misogynistic assclown.On November 13, 2017, after confiding in two of my close friends (a man and a woman) I decided to contact my rapist, and prepared myself for it to go one of two ways: 1. He would respond, be accountable, accept responsibility, apologize and acknowledge that he was a bully in college who made awful decisions that he regretted and has spent the last 28 years becoming a better person, remorseful for any pain he may have caused. Or 2. He would ignore my message and pretend that it ever happened.It was both: He responded and he pretended it never happened.I sent a message via LinkedIn and within seconds I received a reply. It was simple: “Hi Francesca. Thanks for reaching out! I’m open to talk.”, and he provided his cell phone number. I was hopeful as I’ve been told that I am an eternal optimist often giving the benefit of the doubt to people who are undeserving. I didn’t call right away. In fact, I drove around my neighborhood nervously and eventually parked in a church parking lot. I sat in my car for about an hour before I finally decided to call. I’d had 28 years to think about what I would say, except that I never imagined I would actually get a chance to say it to the person who raped and physically abused me. I finally called, and he answered on the first ring. He said: “Hello Fran. How are you?” My heart was racing. Suddenly, I was 19 again. I answered, “I’m okay.” And he said: “It doesn’t sound like you’re okay.” And I responded: “You’re right. I’m not.”I took a deep breath and explained how difficult it was for me to make this phone call. He asked why, as if he didn’t know the reason for my call. I said that what happened in 1989 had a profound impact on me and shaped the person I had become and that as the mother of daughters, I would never want them to go through what I experienced. He sat silently as if he was waiting for me to enlighten him on the details. I started to recall the moment I was walking through the quad and he interjected “Oh! You mean that time I was teasing you and dropped you in the water?” Suddenly he remembered the exact day.He remembered stopping me.He remembered giving me a hard time.He remembered throwing me over his shoulder and carrying me to his truck.He remembered dropping me in the mud and offering me a change of clothes.He even remembered using his belt to “spank” me and getting confronted by my then-boyfriend with a baseball bat. He also remembered apologizing (to my boyfriend), saying that he didn’t know I was his girlfriend, as if to say that a single girl was fair game. What he didn’t remember was cornering me and sexually assaulting me. That part, he conveniently did not remember. His voice was calm and confident, almost compassionate.He mentioned that he had heard my story before, from other people, asking him if it was true. He said that he had never touched me in a sexual way because he “could never do that to his boy”, so I reminded him that 1. He and my boyfriend were not friends at the time, and 2. His apology (excuse) to my boyfriend was that he had no idea I was his girlfriend.Then, the bully emerged.#1: Intimidation & Shaming. He said that during his recent conversations about me with former classmates, he recalled I was promiscuous, and that now, after hearing the story directly from me, he would need to consider going back to those people to get “documentation” of my promiscuity. So I told him that I would gladly provide him with a list of all my sexual partners, because the simple fact was that I chose to sleep with those people. He, however, raped me.#2: Victim Blaming. “Why didn’t you ever come to me and talk to me about this back then?” I responded: “Quite honestly, I was 19 and you were extremely intimidating and I was absolutely terrified of you.” I purposely spoke in past tense. The truth is I did blame myself for providing him with information that ultimately motivated him that day: I made it clear that I was unavailable, spoken for, taken, and completely uninterested in him.#3: Invincibility. When I realized that the conversation was not going in the direction of an acknowledgement or an apology, I assured him that my intention was not to ruin his life, his family or his career. That I simply needed closure and an apology would do that for me. He laughed, apologized (for laughing), and said: “I can’t apologize for something I don’t remember, and I’m definitely not worried.”And finally, #4 Manipulation. At the end of our 19 minute conversation, I said I appreciated him taking my call. And, that despite his claim of not remembering, I would never forget. He responded: “Hey Fran, I want you to know that if anyone ever mentions your name to me in the future, I will always tell them that you’re a good person and that I always considered you a friend.”Thank you for the endorsement. To me, you will always be a rapist. #iwillnotbesilenced",JustCesca Sam-Sin Rezaie,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155015901035770&set=gm.150569179001961&type=3,2017-11-22 16:24:41,80,31,0,21,10,2,1,30,16,0
136598840398995_155808901811322,"On the bus on the way home from the senior trip to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk in 1982, the guy on the bus next to me, who was high at the time, fondled my breasts for quite a bit of the ride home under my sweatshirt.  When it started, I pushed his hand away.  I did it several times, but the bus was full and there was no other seat. the young man was a friend who was dating one of my closest friends who was a year behind us and not on the trip, and I eventually resigned myself that there was no graceful way out and just resigned myself and closed my eyes and prayed for it to stop. The next day at school we had an uncomfortable discussion about it, I let him know that it wasn’t “okay”, he apologized (I believe sincerely) and decided to let it go. We remained friends, but I never sat next to him again on a travel bus again. I never told anyone.  I could not see an upside. Speaking out would have destroyed both of us. I was ashamed that I let it happen.  I was embarrassed that I didn’t know how to stop it.  I believed that if I said anything that all of our friends would be forced to pick and choose between us and was honestly fearful that they would choose him over me because he was awesome, funny and charming and I was serious, studious and ordinary.I don’t know if he even remembers that encounter or  if it even made an impression on him. It was 35 years ago and, even though I forgave him and we are still friends, good friends, I still remember it.   And when I remember it, I still feel like I did something wrong.  I logically know that I didn’t but it will always be there.  The impression and impact of that encounter is indelible.It was a lesson that you always need to be on guard because even good guys, sweet guys and good friends aren’t always safe.This is just one of the stories and the actions are in many ways less egregious than most of the other encounters (the guy who swore he didn’t bite but he actually did...) but part of the impact was that it happened with someone who always made me feel safe, someone I trusted.

136598840398995_137396673652545," It all started when I was 5. My mom said that me and brother had to sleep over her friends house. I woke up to her friends son touching my private. I cried and he left me alone because there was other ppl in the room. The next time my grandfather's friend pinned me up in a hallway, when I was coming outside to play and aggresively, rubbed his self on me  until this sticky stuff was running down my leg. I was so scared. He told me I better not open my mouth or he would kill my brother.. A short time went by, One day I was with gramps and he walked up , I guess my eyes and the fact that I pee'd on my self while standing there was a signal for my gramps, because when he took me to change my clothes, he asked me why did I do that? I started crying and told him what had happened. My gramps grabbed his ice pick and told me he'd be back.  I just kept hearing my Great Grand Ma saying "" My only son is going spend the rest of his life in jail"".  My gramps stabbed that man 40+ times with that ice pick... he died, but not immediately... I remember not seeing my gramps through the rest of my younger years until I was abt 12 When he came home.  My gramps died in '97. I have been raped since then, in my adult life but I never mentioned it until now , because I always felt by me telling, It caused someone to lose their life. I didn't want the same thing to happen again with the Males in my family by telling. I suppress it, but sometimes I see it in my dreams, or relive it while I'm driving,  talking , walking or just having a quiet moment with too much time to on my hands to think..

136598840398995_150799318978947,"I wasn’t going to do a me too post at first, however, with the posts that I’ve seen from men, I have decided to share. The guys seem to somehow think that this is something that women are blowing out of proportion. It’s not!! Women have to deal with unwanted cat calls, staring, intimidation, and aggression all the time. For some reason, certain men seem to think that it’s somehow flattering to be sexualized by them. I’m sorry sir, it’s not. It makes women uncomfortable. With that being said, I am not surprised at all by the number of women who have decided to come out and share their stories.  Honestly, I think that almost every woman has one or two.  We become immune to it and accept bad behavior as the norm. This needs to stop.I won’t mention all of the moments when men have made me feel uncomfortable by trying to hit on me in a way that made my flesh crawl(that would take too long).  As a woman you learn to redirect the conversation or move away. On a few occasions, I have not been able to redirect or leave. When I was 14, a friend’s brother punched me in the face and tried to  assault me in my living room. When I was in my 20’s, I was in my attorney’s office where he attempted to grope me and lock me in his office. A few years after that, a former supervisor kept calling me on my extension saying highly inappropriate things. One day, my boyfriend at the time, had to threaten him after he followed me to my house.  I never reported it because I didn’t want to risk losing my job.  Many years later, a male coworker  went through personal pictures I had on my phone and sent them to his phone. I found out through another employee  that he had been showing them to other coworkers.  I reported him to my supervisor and he suggested I let it go because i would be pretty much be put on trial. I agreed. I was promised that he would be removed because of his actions. He wasn’t, I was transferred. The other night my daughter and I talked about an incident she went through in college.  At the time, we weren’t sure how to approach it because of the man’s position.  I didn’t know what to tell her to do. She decided not to say anything because she didn’t want to risk being shunned or terminated. Based on my past experiences, I supported her decision. Women have to prove that they didn’t deserve the abuse while the men are treated like the victims.  This needs to end.  Victims need to speak up. Women need to hold each other up and teach our daughters they don’t have to accept it and our boys that it’s not ok! We should not have to carry shame for someone else’s transgressions.

I don't make this post for the comments, or the added support, I'm creating this post in the hope that my story can lend power to YOUR voice!  I suffer from daily complications of PTSD that was induced due to the situations of my abuse. In order to reduce the emotions I am currently dealing with in order to create this post, I will only state the ages and offenders. 6mo old, my step-grandfather Bill. 5yr old, my babysitters son. 8yr old, my other step-grandfather Bob. 10yr old, My biological grandfather. (INTO FOSTER CARE) 12 1/2yr old raped by my foster brother and his five friends. 18yr old, biological grandfather attempts for the second time and received a blow to his ego....when I told him that his actions towards me as a child made me gay and he could keep his tiny flaccid penis, or put it up his own ass, He'd get off faster that way. Needless to say I was branded a liar and a trouble maker......It's all golden, truth always finds the light. Now, I'm a full time, hands on, don't take my eyes off my kids type of mom. I don't do babysitters, and don't trust no man, aside from my gay best friend and life partner. Throughout my journey I have realized many things about myself.....1. My sexuality, or lack thereof does not define me nor take from my worth!2. My past is exactly that...it may have pushed me where I started .....but it doesn't dictate where I go from here and into the future.3. Guilt holds you down, it's what gives voice to the ideals that you cannot achieve higher than where you came from. 4. That guilt isn't yours to pick up! You didn't ask for it to happen, nor did you give permission to be abused in such a manner. 5. Remember to love yourself daily .....for being a #SURVIVOR and not giving up, where others haven't had the strength and have given in. 6. Demons can only hurt you if you try to hide them, #LiveYourtruth 7. Saying, ""I only act out like this because I have PTSD"" is an excuse and it's a ""learned"" survival tactic called manipulation...Just own ur bad behaviors and actively #Changetomakeyoubetter( We are all survivors, I hope my story helps you to step into the light of yours.🤗😚)",Kiki L Sherlin,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156806858518135&set=gm.147810909277788&type=3,2017-11-13 22:33:12,66,8,6,36,25,0,0,5,0,0

136598840398995_148575419201337," I was sixteen, just started high scool. I should stay over for the weekend  with my rather new boy friend. He identified himself with a cristian cultural belief in which sex before marriage was not ok. So we didn´t do that, but kissing and hugging were ok. And it seemed obviously to be ok to sleep together. We spent a lovely afternoon walking in the countryside, and had dinner with his family. Then we went to his room, where he raped me. I protested and try to get him off me but he was stronger than me. The sudden turn from confidentiality and nearness to violent abuse paralyzed me in feelings of chok, shame, guilt and sorrow. I went into another room where i stayed until I was to be picked up the following afternoon. We never spoke again. It was strange and incriminating to be in the same everyday small circles af the high scool, where he was socializing with my friends. The paralysis turned slowly into a sort of amnesia, and I didn´t tell anybody until a psychotherapist helped me twelve years after. The rape and the fact that I kept it to myself had a deep influence on my life for very long. It made me feel lonely and outcast, and made it difficult for me to be my true self in relations with men, to feel worthy, free and confident.

136598840398995_146227802769432,"My virginity was stolen by a rapist when I was 16 years old. He was 27 and forced himself on me.I regretfully lied and told my dad that I was going to stay at my best friends' house overnight.  Instead, we drove to Minneapolis, (90 minutes away), to see some guys her older brother used to know from their lake house. When the three of us arrived we discovered that he had a couple of his friends over. We partied together for a few hours.  People paired up and then everyone left me alone with him at his house at 3:00 AM. He had seemed nice enough and we had kissed a couple of times that evening.  As soon as my friends drove away, he scooped me up and threw me onto his bed and started undressing me............then I started to panic. I didn't know where they went, where I was, or have a phone number to call (pre-cell phones era).    I begged and pleaded with him to stop. I told him I was a virgin and I was sobbing.  I remember his hands holding my wrists above my head.... and me pleading and crying and then I blacked out. I went somewhere else in my mind I suppose. I think I simply left my body.  This was not an alcohol or drug-induced blackout.  It is a real blessing that I don't remember anything about being raped.  Was I limp, like a dead person?     Did it go on long?            Did I keep screaming?....I don't know.  In the morning, when I awoke he was gone from the bed and I was relieved not to see him. I began to cry when I assembled fractured glimpses of the night before.   He had dressed, made himself breakfast, walked by the bedroom door, and said, ""Thanks for the free fun."" and then he left.   Over the next few weeks, I cried myself to sleep and worried that I would be pregnant or have AIDs. I never pressed charges, because I didn't want to disgrace my family or myself. I just told myself that I was over it.  Years later, a boyfriend grabbed my wrists and squeezed them while we were having sex. I began screaming (like someone who was being murdered).  I was terrified in that moment....and so was my boyfriend!  I woke the household and neighborhood. I freaked us all out!   I can't remember ever screaming so loud.  Apparently, his grabbing my wrists, triggered a repressed memory from when I had blacked out during the rape.  I guess I really never got over it, maybe I never will. I promised myself that the next man who tried to rape me would be a dead man....If there is ever a next time, I will not blackout. I will fight to the death.",Liz Seyberth,,status,,2017-11-08 22:01:02,72,22,0,14,8,0,1,42,7,0

136598840398995_146002056125340,"I was stalked in high school. A frightening male student who said if I went to the prom with anyone else but him,he'd kill me. He wrote me notes ""see you in the graveyard."" It was 1975 and my parents did nothing. I was alone in our home while my parents were at our cabin. I'd walk home from work and he was in my yard just standing under our trees. It was a terrifying summer. Our house was not secure. Finally it stopped. The police would not have helped and I knew telling them would put me in further danger. When my sister was stalked by a violent mentally ill boy the police in my hometown said ""Well a pretty girl like you? I don't blame him.He tried to hit her with his car.My maternal grandfather held my ass for a long time in lieu of the hug I gave him for the $5 he gave me at my high school graduation party. I told my mom. She said ""oh he's so awful."" Only decades later when she was dying, she told me he had molested her at the age of 5. She never told anyone but her mother. She just made sure we (her five daughters) were never alone with him. Generations kept secrets because of shame and fear of breaking up families - that was the unwritten rule. Otherwise you were met with ""what did you do to make him think you were interested? How were you dressed? What do you expect? Did you dance close?"" Poor men (sarcasm) my mother was convinced by women of generations before her that boys were not responsible for themselves once they were aroused. The middle school my daughter attended sent her home on a sweltering day because she had a blouse on that had cut outs on the shoulders. Shoulders apparently distract the true victims of their sexuality, males. Amazing to me that sounds some still believe this sh*t.My first experience with sexual intercourse was a month after I turned 18. He said.was a Christian  I had just moved to Minneapolis from my small town. We were making out on my twin bed where I was staying with my sister and brother-in-law. I said no and he shoved his penis in me; then he left. I remember looking at the bit of blood in my panties and realizing I had lost my virginity to a horrible person; my boss. I had to face him daily. He had nothing more to do with me and my first drunken experience a month later I was suicidal and thankful to this day I was with women who stayed with me through the night.I was stalked my the man who owned the trailer park I lived in while my boyfriend was overseas. He looked in the windows and hung out in my yard. One night I heard a shotgun. It was him, drunk and firing his gun in the air. My best friends in Mpls were a couple. I worked with the woman. I was 18. She left town for a week and he agreed to drive me home from work. He said he needed to use the bathroom and I agreed. He always seemed so safe and they were clearly in love. He used the bathroom and pushed me down on my sofa telling me he needed to show me how to defend myself in case I was raped. I talked to him gently reminding him that his fiance would be so devastated if he had sex with me. I got him out of there and locked my door. According to several people, primarily my family, I ""asked"" for it my family said. When you are pretty and busty you should downplay it. I worked hard to hide my breasts with big shirts etc.2 dentists I worked for - one grabbed our legs when were standing on stools reaching for files. ""someone needs a shave,"" he'd say. It was 1980 and I turned to him and said ""Don't touch me anymore or ask me if I got any last night."" I'll slap a sexual harassment suit on you so fast...! The next day he had a meeting with the 4 young women who worked for him. This included me. He said if anyone ever messed with his life he'd kill them and he put his pistol on the desk to bring the point home.I secured a job with another dentist and he was a good family man of course.. On my first day, I took my sack lunch out of my drawer and the two other young women took me aside and said I shouldn't stay at the office alone with him. Of course I asked why and they told me he'd exposed himself to them several times. I left for lunch and never went back. I reported him to the Dental Board. The women from his office called me frantically telling me to stop and they denied everything. Their husbands were in a side business with the dentist and they didn't want to screw that up. They were very trapped. I filed my report and felt completely depressed.By that time I had two toddlers. I was also getting so very tired of hearing, experiencing and realizing the huge problem we had with sexual harassment in our country.The biggie here is about my brother-in-law , a chiropractor who was married to my oldest sister. I left  California to be with my parents one winter while my young husband was on a West Pac on an aircraft carrier in the Navy. It was brutally cold in N.E. Minnesota. I started working for my brother-in-law.While I was working there he offered to adjust me as I have a horrible back. The adjustments quickly became breast massages and I froze. He could see I was concerned and he told me it was part of a chiropractic adjustment. I was 21. I should have known better or so they say. With other adjustments he'd lean in me and I could feel his erection.  However,  I needed the job, I couldn't tell my parents and my sister would have immediately become suspicious if I quit. Our family would blow up and I would have to be removed immediately.It took years and a visit to a marriage counselor before I named it. And years before I filed an official complaint with the MN State Board of Chiropractors. When the secretary to the Attorney General went to NE MN to investigate,she asked me what to expect. I said ""3 things. They will say I am promiscuous. I am after money.They will ask you if you are Christian?"" She was not got off guard because they did indeed say or ask all those things.  Of course was immediately discredited by my immediate family because she answered ""No, I'm Jewish.""My family no longer spoke to me. One sister did support me and she knew my accusation was absolutely true. The rest - cousins, sisters and parents all cut me off. I went through 13 years of hell. 15 years later he was charged by 4 additional women. It was 2004.  however, he was careful enough to take them out of the office and told the judge he was ""dating"" them. They were all employees. 90 day suspension.was his punishment. He's now retired, but at my 40th class reunion in 2015 women whispered to me that there were many many others. I believed I was the only one. I came forward for other women and for his daughters. At 55 I sighed with relief when I started a new job. I had previously worked primarily with women and now I felt a job with a print company of primarily men (4 women - 60+ men) I would no longer have to deal with sexual advances, sexual harassment etc.Somewhere in my mind, I still believed it was about youth and the idea of beautiful a man had of a woman.  I was wrong and realized days into my new job by unwelcome comments and questions that were completely inappropriate.I was very determined to tell my daughter what to do if anyone - coworker, teacher, grandfather or any family friend or relative. She grew up with the knowledge I had stood up to the sexual abuse in our family and made a huge sacrifice. My daughter did not know her cousins, her grandmother or grandfather, aunts or uncles. No one believed me and if they did they quietly told me they thought it could be true but don't tell anyone else. When my daughter was 16 she and a boyfriend of sorts were watching TV in the basement. She came up the stairs and said ""He's leaving mom."" He had pulled out his penis to show her it was erect and as instructed she said ""I know where penises are and I'll let you know if I want to see it. Zip up and leave.""Unfortunately, I helped her get a sales job with our ink vendor. She was given a great salary, gas card and use of a company car. One evening she was very quiet at home (she was probably 23 at the time) I asked her if she was ok and she burst out crying. The Ink rep who I knew and who was training her had touched her multiple times when they were on the road in Colorado. She was driving once and he ran his hand up her leg. He commented on her large breasts and he asked her what sort of underwear she wore.My heart sank. What did I miss? Why couldn't I have prevented this. Well, men in positions of authority who molest or harass women know when they are most vulnerable and are well practiced in this heinous behavior.I called an attorney that I knew from a part time job I had a few years prior. The firm was all women (at other firms men called their practice ""The Coven"") and they were strictly employment and sexual harassment attorneys. I learned that the even most intelligent, accomplished and confident women were shaken as they brought their cases to us. I heard stories of young Vietnamese girls new to the United States  getting a job at a McDonalds only to be groped and forced to have sex with their manager. They never lost a case.Immediately after my daughter described the things her boss ""R"" had done to her, the lawyer contacted the Ink company and we felt good that we had someone on our side. One male employee did agree to tell management that he witnessed ""R""  lift up my daughter's dress in the hallway at the office. My daughter faced the entire management staff and ""R"" alone at a conference table and told her story. Of course he denied everything, but they had enough evidence and eyewitnesses to investigate the charges. He claimed he was driving when she accused him of running his hand up her leg so how could he have done that? My daughter was indeed driving and after several other lies and omissions it was clear he was was guilty. This ended his 36 year career with the company. I was so proud of my daughter; however immediately after that meeting, ""R"" went to every print company in the city and called others telling them about this crazy bitch who just started working for him and she told lied about him and he lost his job. These were customers of his for decades.  Our attorney wrote a letter to ""R"" insisting he stop the libel or we would officially charge him. But the damage was done. My daughter could not deal with the angry buyers accusing her of ruining the career if not life of a dedicated employee, husband and father of 3. This proved to be a long post. It's a long read but now I don't have to write that book! smile. I'll end on a more positive and hopeful note. The Denver print company I worked for was purchased by another company in Northern CO. Many printing companies were closing their doors and we hired many of them. The IT guy from the Loveland CO office came down 2 days a week to work with me and get things in order for me to navigate the new  to me computer system etc. A few of the old but new to me male Sales Reps had no problem telling me dirty (really raunchy) jokes, commenting on my breasts (they were in one guys way - he couldn't see the file cabinet) One slapped my butt. One noticed I had toothpaste in the corner of my mouth and accused me having oral sex the night before and not washing my mouth. That tall thin IT guy took me aside. He had the most gentle eyes and I really liked him a lot. He asked me point blank if I was dealing with any sort of inappropriate behavior and he would like to help if that was the case. He already new it was a problem; he witnessed some of it. I tried to talk to the President of Sales. As happens so often in so many offices across the country, he said he'd talk to the guy but there wasn't anything he could do. It was a he said/she said thing.At that point I was too tired and had encountered so much rage after telling the truth from both male managers and the men I was victimized by that I just couldn't pursue it. The men who were spoken to would walk by my desk and say things like ""Oh, I don't know if I should talk to you anymore. I don't want to say anything that will offend you..."" Jerks.Back to the IT guy from the Northern CO print company,I had never met a safer man and we went out after my job was redundant Well, I have lived with him for 7 years now. We respect each other and it's still difficult for me to trust he won't start abusing me as other men in my life have.He's been great as I learn about respect for me and all women. He still has those kind eyes and I love him. We have traveled and had lots of fun just being together. I only hope more men like Steve come forward and do not turn the other way when they see these things happening to women at the work place. (or anyplace) Maybe one of my stories will resonate with one of you. I appreciate the opportunity to finally write my unfortunate past. I will never heal completely but I decided a long time ago I didn't want those bastards to take away my power and sexuality. I'm still in therapy at age 60; I'm still fighting for myself and learning to love myself. It has been a very long journey.I",Mary Anttila,,status,,2017-11-08 07:05:13,34,8,0,17,8,1,1,7,0,0

136598840398995_142503953141817,"I guess here we go... Here is my story, a story that affects my everyday life/me. It all started when I was 13-14 years of age. My grandma had started to develop Alzheimer’s a disease that would soon take away all her memory of things that went on. She would have memory of only the past. Me being me wanted to help, I decided that I would be the one who would give my grandma all the love and attention she needed when nobody else could/while they had to work and provide for their own household family. I started staying weeks at a time, I loved it. I loved staying with my grandma until I met a man, a man who completely changed me and my way of life. This man was an alcoholic, 40 years of age, a generally scary looking man. I thought to myself, hmm... I don’t know how to feel about him he looks like he’s up to know good, and that he was. He started coming around everyday, popping in for a visit. Soon those days turned into nights, this man started staying over night in the back room of my grandmas house. He’d made himself welcome in her home and I didn’t know what I could do about it. I felt there was nothing I could do, I tried to brush it off and tell myself it was nothing/it was ok. What a mistake. This man had made his way into my room and raped me. He did this multiple times and proceeded to tell me if I told he would kill himself. I couldn’t be the reason someone killed then selves I thought. I let this go on and said nothing. I had started to develop depression, I was so sad I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to tell someone, someone I could trust/someone who wouldn’t tell. I told someone very close to me that I needed to talk and made  him promise not to tell if I told him what was going on, he agreed. Not long after I had told him the home phone started ringing. I rushed and grabbed it before anyone else could. It was my dad, he wanted to know what was going on. All I could do was bawl, I couldn’t speak. He said Kylie is there something going on and the only word that I managed to get out was yes. My chest was tight, this man was standing in the kitchen door way staring at me and wanted to know what was going on. He was gonna rape me again that night and he said I was gonna like it. A lot of stuff happened that night, stuff I’m not gonna go into detail about because I don’t really wanna talk about it. But can I just say people who say it’ll get better it’ll be fine, how?!! I am 16 and still don’t know how to deal with it. I have anxiety,depression,And very bad paranoia at night. I get so scared sometimes that I start puking and shaking and wish I could just end it all by taking my own life.

136598840398995_146204566105089,"I got out of a almost year long abusive relationship August of last year. In January I was at a party and that guy was there. We both drank, him more then me. He was completely plastered. We made out in the hall way. And I was confused, as he just kind of cut me off knew I was still hooked on him. and now this. He went into the bathroom, I followed.“Why did you kiss me?”He pulled me in and we continued. He asked me to mess with him. I said “were at a party..” he said “So?” I said fine...for a minute. So I did. When I had for about a minute or two, I looked at him and sad that’s it..I can’t do this. He said “nah let’s fuck”I said no.He said...and these words still ring.“To bad.” And he pulled my pants off and entered me. I tried to stand, I said no, I didn’t want to scream so many people were there...I was embarrassed. He just pushed me down. Afterwards he told everyone at the party “I didn’t just rape faith” I was silent the whole time. I talked to police. They told me I was raped.A few months later his best friend came to check on me and started making out with me. I pulled away.He backed me into my room and began to undress me. I said (name) we’re moving fast...He kept going. Without a word.

It was my fav so I drank. Alot. I was 18 and didn't  know when to stop... I had a rough childhood and I just knew I finally felt good when I drank. He came on me, I said no. He asked why but I was too drunk to protect myself. I lost respect for myself. Because I didnt fight back enough didn't think it was rape. I told my bf at the time what happened the next morning. I felt so ashamed but he knew I was takin advantage of. I no longer felt good in my once secure relationship. We broke up. I broke up with him because I did not feel good enough for him  anymore.Because I lost self respect and just trying to find someone I felt good enough with.

136598840398995_143785039680375,"I saw an article about Rose McGowan saying she had been slut-shamed over rape allegations.  I know exactly what she means, and I want to suggest we express the process in different terms so that the negative connotations reflect upon the person who engages in that behavior, and not the victims themselves.  I will never refer to myself as a slut.  People have hurled that term at me since I was 9 years old.  I didn't deserve it then and I don't deserve it now.  I virtually guarantee that few people on this thread have been in as many destructive and sexually exploitative relationships as I have unless they were trafficked, which is an even worse form of exploitation and abuse.  I do not consider myself to be promiscuous and I will never use that word either, or allown anyone else to apply that term to me or my behavior when I was younger because it implies a lack of values only and ignores the truth of an inability to protect oneself.  When I recognize how many times I was molested, date-raped, statutorily raped, and had my body penetrated with objects as a punishment for the purpose of making me more functional in a dysfunctional family system, I lost all sense of any kind of boundaries, much less a recognition that I had a right to establish them for myself.  Some of the most trusted people in my life used my body for their own purposes that interestingly never made me feel like I deserved abuse, yet rendered me completely incapable of actually avoiding abuse.  I have been treated despicably by the very people who set me up to accept this kind of behavior, who use my poor choices in partners as evidence of my worthlessness rather than a reflection of how I learned how to expect to be treated by other people from the exact same people who now blame me for gravitating toward the familiar.  It has taken me half a century to recognize how much ill will people I love have displayed toward me throughout life.  I have finally made the decision to to cease contact with them.  I love them and care about them and wish them no ill.  I hope for reconciliation, but at this point, I am uninterested in taking ANY steps toward that happening.  I can only speak for now, but I have total peace in my decision whether we are ever reunited again or not.  I do not miss the drama, the petty accusations, the competition, the sniping, the blaming, the character assassination.  It really has been horrible.  I made excuses for them repeatedly until I stopped attributing the goodwill I felt, and continue to feel, for them, and acknowledged the truth that they did not display these same qualities in their relationship with me.  I do not tolerate bad behavior from people anymore.  I choose to surround myself with loving, respectful people.  Setting standards for what we are willing to accept is a huge step, and a signficant step in the healing process.  Every one of us has the right to be treated with dignity, compassion and respect, and to refuse to keep company with people who fail to meet those standards.  Our first responsibility is to ourselves and our own well being.  When we fill ourselves up with self-love and value and appreciate our own selves in the way we have sought to be treated by others, then our love will overflow and extend to every human on the planet, even if we cannot allow them in our presence for our own well-being.  It is not about revenge, accountability, power, etc.  It is about contentment, peace, and living a life according to one's own purpose and desires.

He held me down on my stomach & pinned my arms. He then forced himself inside me, anal b/c he new how much I hated it. I screamed for help b/c we had roommates but no one came.  When he finished I discovered quite a bit of blood.  He then told me it felt like fucking a whore & left for the rest of the night. It  may sound really stupid but it took me a long time to be able to label it as rape, I was young & naive & I thought it couldn't be rape if u had already had sex with the guy & were in a relationship. I also had two other attempts, one by a guy from the club in 1998 luckily a friend intervened  & stopped what was happening.

136598840398995_145028219556057,"My story may not be as bad as some of the others here, but it has affected my whole life. First abuse was in elementary school by a fellow friend, who did a demeaning act on my private area. Made me feel like a second-class outsider. Later, I had to go through some medical treatment for a few years that did seem to promote some bullying but I was determined to change and be more outgoing. Unfortunately, my parent's friend believed it was an invitation to maul my breasts, among other things. I never told as it was a small community and a supposed family friend, though it did make me more weary, Including receiving a letter from an older man that my Dad befriended on a field trip. My parents encourage me to respond, as it was the proper thing to do, out of respect. I never did. I did meet a very caring husband, whose work took him away a lot so I was responsible for looking after all maintenance of the house. Part of this was the contract for the furnace. This service person became so friendly that he popped around the house unexpectedly. Thinking he was interested in a private business that we were building at the time, I invited him in to discuss business though I later found out it was another business he had in mind, when he forced me to kiss him while mauling me, with my young children in the other room. I managed to force him out the door and cancelled that contract. Another time was when I was volunteering with the police departments and going to various workshops and conferences. At one conference, one officer cornered me in a closed doorway, and again, mauled me trying to get me to go to his room. Luckily, another friend came by and I was able to escape that situation. The last demeaning act was when I was working customer service and one customer kept coming in making comments like I and his girlfriend were slaves, among other things. Again, I was lucky to have a supportive manager, who was willing to be present whenever this customer came in and basically told him to take a hike that his business was not welcomed. All this over a 50 year period, but this and my medical treatment left me with low self-esteem hidden deep down that I try to cover up. Thankfully, I have a good family and good support, though the past does pop up ever now and then, bringing back the depression.",Llweyn Friars,,status,,2017-11-04 21:07:56,14,5,0,2,3,0,1,8,0,0

We were in Orlando and my first class told our division when we go out to stay in groups which I did . when we all returned to the ship I went to the galley to make some ramen noodles and one of the shipmates who I knew and spoke to plenty of times asked me if I was tired I said no why he asked if I wanted to learn about the ship so I can get my sea qualifications I said sure.  He was an engineer so he knew about the part  the ship I didn't know about . he took me to  bottom of the  ship where the anchor was i didn't think twice about it. Once I got down there I had to crawl through some crawl space and then that's when it happened. I was raped and held down every  time I tried to fight him and push him off I either got choked or  my legs pushed down. I kept say stop and  he told me to stop fighting him that he was almost finished. So I stopped fighting. He told me  to go wash up.  I looked  down and there was blood every where.  I got  dressed went took  a  shower but saved my clothes. The next day I went and  someone.come to find out everyone knew about  it  and there were a group of men that  this to women on the ship  but no one ever came forward . I gave my captain my clothes they took me to do  rape kit . I spoke to a female jag  officer to report what happened and  question him. Our  stories matched and the jag officer told me  not to go through with  it  so I didn't and in the end he  got away with  and I was the  one  who got busted down in rank,Kris Barry,,status,,2017-11-05 07:11:28,42,7,4,6,2,0,1,10,23,0

The pain the emotions and fear these stories create are the same no matter the story. Instead I would like you to know that you are not alone and you are all powerful women who can create great beauty.It's time for us to unite as one. We need to start supporting and protecting each other. Do not allow the stories of the past define who you are now. You can use the past to empower yourself so as to not allow it to ever happen again.  For me it was to continue living life, learning to heal my wounds and making peace with this world. Learning self defence has been a great tool for empowering myself. Over three years now and it feels good that I now know how to kick some ass if I have to. ha ha  Sadly we leave in a world where all women and children need to learn how to defend themselves. Do not get me wrong. There are some incredible men out there who do honour and respect women.  Unfortunately there are many who only project their rage and fears. That is not o.k. The excuses have to stop now. If you are reading this please know that we can not change the past, we have no control of the future. All we have is the now.  Right now you can create whatever dreams you wish to have for yourself and you do not have to allow past actions of some sad, weak, wounded little men define who you are.

These actresses are turning in those who are their “bread and butter”. THAT is how true it is! They know they will face stigma! That’s how true it is! They know they may never get jobs as actress’s again! That’s how true it is! Women face this shit every day! To deny it is ludicrous! We have just learned that no one believes us, no one cares, and we get made out to be the assholes for telling! Soooooo, from now on I will report to you EVERY sexual harassment, assault, or rape I encounter (and I have encountered a LOT in my lifetime)! I am now a Middle Aged woman, so I would think sexual harassment would end by now, but no it has not! I have received more than my fair share of sexual harassment, assault, and even rape when I was a younger woman, but I still experience too much of this crap! Not as much as before but way too much, so from now on, consider my reports on it, and I hope more women will start reporting every such event themselves too until the world can no longer deny!

136598840398995_142490233143189,"I have been hoping for a movement like this for a long time, and doubted it would be in my lifetime. I just decided to start a list of specific incidents and it took me like 2 minutes to come up with four in my adult life.After that I just kept remembering and writing it down. Most of these do not include incidents of inappropriate comments. Only ones where I was actually touched or grabbed. Here it is.  #WomenAreDoneWithTakingThisShitAt 20yrs old A man at a state employment office closed his office door then grabbed me and kissed me. I had my very first apartment by myself when I was 21, I didn't have a phone yet. Alone late at night and heard someone knock lightly on the door. When I looked out the little window on the door a guy was standing on the walk masturbating. I was terrified. I grabbed a broom started banging on the wall yelling at the neighbor to call the police but she didn't hear me or ignored me. Finally I opened the door and ran out yelling at him to get the fuck away and swinging that broom. he ran like hell then I went to a pay phone and called police. A few nights later a guy I was dating was there with me. I looked up and the same guy was looking in the window. The guy that was with me jumped up and ran to the door and chased him. When he came back he said he knew the guy from school. We both went to the police station and gave a report. The picked him up right away. Then I actually moved away and found out later that Bill had gone to court and testified against the guy and he had been convicted. I doubt he got much if any time, but it did get followed thru.When I was 23-24 I was stalked by a guy I had gone out with a few times then broke it off. He never threatened me physically but I was living in San Antonio at the time and I would be driving down the road and look in my mirror and he'd be right behind me. Or I'd come out of work and he was sitting across the parking lot waiting for me to come out. And constantly calling me both at work and home. I was staying with my brother and his family at the time and my brother and told him not to call me there. He had stopped doing so, but then they went out of town one day. I walked in the house from work and the phone was ringing. I picked up the phone and it was him. He knew they were gone and I was alone.At 25 I was returning to my apartment from the laundry room. I stopped to open a gate and a man came up behind me and fondled me and be for I could even react he ran. I never even saw his face.When I was 28 a man that I had been friendly with said he wanted to hug me, but when I gave him a hug he grabbed me and kissed me. He was a much older man and it was in the workplace but no on else was in the area.When I was 29 I had to travel on a long trip by bus. An older man with b/o sat next to me. I didn't protest because all seats were full. It was night and he pretended to nod off on my shoulder and fondled me.Also at 29 I was visiting New Orleans with a friend. At a restaurant my friend struck up a conversation with some guys at the next table. When we got up to leave they did as well and right in the middle of a crowded restaurant one of them fondled my butt. I was at a point then I was not going to take it quietly I figured if he was bold enough to do that there then he shouldn't mind me screaming at him that he had no right to touch me without invitation.That is as far as I've gotten written down.

136598840398995_142131223179090,"I've been holding on too long from my experience with sexual assault/harrassment. Here's my story:I was 5 years old and I was at my grandmother's house on my day off from school. A cousin of mine (won't mention names) and I were watching TV like many people do. Then, my cousin wanted me to play ""rollercoaster"" with him. Then, the next thing I remember was when he pulled down his pants and exposed his penis to me that I froze in shock, confusion, and horror. I was afraid of what he was planning on doing next. So, what I did was that I told him not to do that that he decided not to violate me any further. I've never told ANYBODY in my family until now. But, the thing is that I actually forgave him. Luckily, he didn't do anything else, but being exposed like that was something that any child should NEVER experience. I forgive him so much 'cuz he's my cousin that I love very much. But, still, he had NO right to expose himself.Second, I was in high school Spanish class during my junior year when a friend of my best friend sexually harrassed me. He was sitting behind me and he would say stuff like ""You're so hot"" and ""I wanna fuck you."" The worst part was that I fell for it and was deeply confused. Next thing I remember, he put BOTH his hands underneath my behind and rubbed my shoulders. I regret not reporting it to the teacher and the principal, fearing that I would also lose my best friend. There was another time I was at my best friend's house when he randomly appeared and I didn't want him to be around me, but he resisted on coming, anyway. When the 3 of us sat outside the backyard, he asked me if I had sex recently and I uneasily answered no. Then, 15 minutes later, he was talking about how nice my behind looked. Suddenly, I got so furious at him for talking that kind of sick shit. Then, he made this ridiculous excuse by claiming it was a compliment and that he was drunk. I even told my friend on why she would be friends with that disgusting dildo. She replied by telling me that he was just being ""friendly."" Ever since that incident, I never saw him again and I hope it stays that way. I REALLY hate his guts so much! I'm glad that I've FINALLY got stuff out of my chest. It's not my fault for being violated. I just wanted to share my experience with sexual harrassment/assault. To those who went though such things like that, do NOT blame yourselves.

I started working when I was eight years old, in the cotton fields with my parents. I was a tiny girl and i wasn't big enough to chop cotton, but I was sure big enough to pick it. I worked with my parents, so I was safe, but my first job without them was working in a Frosty Freeze at 18 yrs old and that asshole boss, would come rub himself up on me. I'd push him away, but that didn't stop him. He did the same thing to my cousin and we didn't know about sexual harassment in 1971 or 72. We ended up quitting that job and went to work in the potato sheds in Edison part of Bakersfield, California. I've quit so many jobs in my life, cause it seemed like these men always wanted to grab my ass or try to kiss me. I'm sure that this has happened to so many women, but they didn't say anything, because they were afraid of losing their jobs, back in the day.I'd even venture to say that it's happened to men also. I say I was safe, when I worked with my parents, but going home was another story. At six yrs old I was raped by an old man that lived next door. Then when I was nine, I was raped by a 13 yr old boyThen raped when I was 16 and ended up pregnant, by a guy that lived up the street and he was 19. My mother made me marry him, he continued to rape me and after I had my son, he kept raping me and I got pregnant again. My two sons are 11 months apart. We were dirt poor and I had to endure it, but after my second son was born. The land lady called the police, because he was coming after me with a broken beer bottle and she could hear me screaming.

136598840398995_142185869840292,"Thank you for the add. I will start with the beginning of the worse 8 years. I was 16 when I met the man that had become a haunting image forever burned in my mind. He seemed so nice and normal but had that bad boy bone that I was attracted to. I only hung out with him for a short time then found another man that I was with for a year and was engaged to that whole year. I know quick to jump into it. Well I left him to be with the man that is the monster I have nightmares about. We were together 5 months then got pregnant with our beautiful son. We got married when our son was only 6 months old. But before we even got married the nightmare began. I was only about a two months pregnant when he attempted to rape me. He told me he was going to rape me like his brother does. Well we were in his moms driveway in our white Honda we has. Luckily he was to drunk to realize he was not in my private and his private was on my stomach. Well we went inside and went to bed. Well the next morning he had forced sex with me. He was so angry with me and so rough. I wanted to scream but I thought his mom and his brothers girlfriend would think I did something to provoke him or it was my fault cause I wasn't giving it enough and I was afraid of what he would have done. It didn't stop their he would have sex with me while I was sleeping. I would wake up with my panties off and it would be wet and gross feeling in my private. Well over time we moved to Alaska when our son was 2 and we got pregnant again and I found out at 3 weeks the baby didn't make it cause one day our son was playing and he wanted to have sex well I was on my side I started getting sharp pains and was saying ouch and he just wouldn't stop. Well I lost the baby at 5 weeks and didn't know till I was 6 weeks when they confirmed through a ultrasound. That was the hardest day. After that we stayed there for a year then moved back. After we were back for a month or so we found out I was pregnant again. We were so happy but it wasn't an easy pregnancy at all. To add to that he still was always so horny all the time and I wasn't so many times he was forcefull. One time I told him to stop and was crying cause I was 7 months pregnant and I was having contractions and he wouldn't stop till he was done. He said he didn't know I was crying and he didn't hear me say stop. Which is bull. I got in the shower and calmed down and they stopped. The abuse never stopped it got more and more with each day. He would take my clothes off when I was sleeping and continue to have his way. A few times i would wrap my legs like a pretzel and help them tight togther and he still was forceful. It didn't stop. He was a drug addict took our kids money from their piggy banks and say he will pay it back but never did. He would take my car all my money and disappear for days. It was me and the kids. I didn't trust him to have the kids by himself. Especially our daughter. When she was a baby she had to have suppositories and he got so upset with me cause he wanted to do it. And always wanted just her instead of both of them. Finally after years of abuse and taking everything from me except our kids I kicked him out May 5, 2015 and got a divorce. It was finalized October 5, 2015.  He got married to another woman the next month and had a daughter in April 2016 two days before our daughters 3rd birthday. I happily moved on I've been with my fiancee since June 2015 and we will be getting married in July 2018. He's the total opposite. Weird still to this day being in a healthy relationship but so nice. However their real dad has always been in and out and this time we haven't heard from him since December 23rd 2016. This is the longest usually it was just a few days then a month now it's almost a year. It's been nice not having to see him in person but he still haunts my life with the things he said and did. It comes up in my relationship a lot. Just a small triger turns into world war 4 in my head. I got PTSD,Anxiety, Depression from all of this. I have my strong and week points but would like to learn how to deal with the flashbacks and the anger that has arised as well.

The situation I experienced wasn’t near as traumatic as some of other women’s circumstances captured, yet it still has lead to shame and reduced trust in boys/men. I think I was only 14, I was alone, in a large shopping mall and some random boy grabbed me “down there” on the escalator. I was shocked and startled, felt trapped and did not have the courage or conviction to call him on his actions and push him away or say this was wrong. I can’t believe some boys/men still feel this behaviour was okay. While not as severe a story as others it still haunts and affects me, even though it was years ago.

136598840398995_142467726478773,By far all of you know about the  #movement. One thing I can’t understand is - why do we need a #celebrity to endorse our beliefs. After #Alyssa #Milano tweeted “me too” a huge number of #real #life #stories of #sexual #assault came to surface. Will the #women and #girls speak only when a #mogul like Harvey Weinstein is criticized by #Hollywood? We all are the women of #21thcentury; have the freedom to speak and liberty to lead our lives. #Harassment to women has been a part of the culture especially in India where countless women are victims of domestic violence. If the #Me #Too response came 10 years prior when Ms #Tarana #Burke started her #campaign; #Harvey #Weinstein would be sued during his first few attempts. On several occasions I did not had the autonomy to wear what I wanted to just because I do not grab attention from a boy. Why? I have to wear long shirts inside of the stunning designer toppers I was dying to wear. I suppressed by desire to dance during public events because a group of boys were in front line. How a girl dressed herself or looks can’t not change the perspective of a person (be it a boy or a girl) than why are we advised to cover all over. Wake up #boys and #young #ladies. Don’t be a follow the moment only because it is in trend; bring change in yourself and respect each other’s dignity. Feel and act.,Romana Sharma,,status,,2017-10-29 12:32:38,11,4,0,9,2,0,0,0,0,0

I will say thought that my abuser was the only person I had in my life.... my whole life. I had no other family members around. I do have children and I don't allow him alone with them. It would probably be much better if I disowned him. Maybe I could get past things easier. He is all I've ever known though, and I feel a sense of loyalty to him. ""He didn't have to raise me"", ""He could have left too"". I'm all he's had too. His health isn't at its greatest, and I can't just let him die alone.A few years ago I did confront him in an email about one of the situations he put me through as a child. He cried and apologized. He said he wished he could take it all back. Since then I've felt some sort of relief. Having children of my own though has brought back some fears. He doesn't understand what I've been through emotionally for over 20 years. He doesn't know how he's affected my relationships, or my fears when it comes to my own husband with my children. Part of me wants to bring it up again, but I feel at this point it would be like beating a dead horse. I feel like I have other people in my life that would find out I was talking about it again, and accuse me of just wanting attention. I mean... what good does bringing it up again and again do. If I can't get over it... I probably should distance myself from him.

136598840398995_142194043172808,"Has anyone ever been too scared of hate to leave home? (I wrote a novel with this title). On another subject:My articles blog is at: http://anne-hart-writes.blogspot.com/2017/10/when-employees-were-told-to-color-code.html?view=classicWhen employees were told to color-code the files of a private staffing agency's walk-in female job applicants by their beauty, appearance, and age.In the early 1970s I worked in staffing at an employment agency interviewing job applicants before they were sent out to interview for jobs. We had little color codes that we were ordered to put on the applications of those who came in looking for work.The 'boss' told us not to send out to interview for secretarial jobs the female applicants who had stated on their applications that they were ""age 34"" or over because that was too old (for staffing to send out to employers). We also were told only to send out 'ugly' females for clerical, typing, and secretarial jobs to one company because the woman who hires there only hires 'ugly' women (the boss told us only to send women that the particular manager at that one company considers 'uglier' than herself (because the interviewer is an 'ugly' middle-aged woman).I only can speak about the 'rules' for female walk-in job applicants, as I was not told to color code the very few males who applied for clerical office work that I interviewed in the short time I worked there. At first the employment services staff didn’t know that previously I had worked for that same so-called 'ugly' woman. I was a new staffing services employee whose job was to interview applicants. When I announced...""Hey, I used to work as a typist for that company,"" the staff at the employment agency had a bout of laughing out loud.Interestingly, it was around 1973, I had a college degree in English, was eventually working on my M.A. in English/creative writing, and realized, the woman who was hiring only 'ugly' women, as they put it, actually had been hiring younger women who looked very much like she looked, not 'ugly,' simply someone with similar looks and hair color. It was all about what that employer perceived herself looking like and didn't want someone with (as the staffers put it) more 'photographable' faces than what she thought she had.The 'boss' also commented on my waist size when I was interviewed. ""Gee, you have such a tiny waist for someone with two children,"" he grinned. ""I hope you won't get 'preggers' and quit if I hire you."" Needless to say, I didn't work in staffing long because of the way the company color coded women according to age and appearance. Nothing was mentioned about race, just age and whether they were ugly or pretty.The older female job applicants weren't sent out on clerical or secretarial jobs. The agency interviewed applicants mainly for office jobs such as typing, shorthand, and bookkeeping skills.It was an eye-opening experience to work in staffing where people were coded with different color dots on their records representing age and beauty according to the boss's standards. Just glad to finally have earned my M.A. degree and left for a different career in freelance writing and later adjunct part-time college teaching in professional writing skills until I retired in 2004.",Anne Hart,,status,,2017-10-28 15:48:58,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

I have vivid memories of laying beneath my cousin as he panted and sweated all over me while moving around on top of me, this was set to a timer to see how long I could handle it. I couldn't breath. I was so hot and I remember my leg and tummy getting wet. I was 6 or 7. There was no safe place at their house. Or in the fort we played in. It was always a sexual game.  I knew in movies people kissed and layed on top of each other and had a baby,  at age 6 I thought I could have a baby due you what was happening,  not knowing how babies were made at such a young age.  I waited in fear watching my tummy. Thinking the worst.  This continued on throughout my entire childhood,  we'll into my teen years,   kissing grabbing fondling and oral sex. I would prepare myself thinking I wanted the attention,  knowing I was an easy target,  any dark room,  any chance they got.   I never told . Years later one of them apologized to me, and then told me he chose  me because he knew my father wouldn't do anything,  he wasn't scared of him they way he was another uncle. He left my cousin alone,  terrified of her father! This has shaped my entire view of men, I'm scared of any affection towards my daughter from men, I worry all the time I'm missing something.  I think so poorly if myself,  I've put up with 2 abusive men in my life and I really think I'm better off alone,  as these thoughts and fears never leave me .  I don't know what normal fatherly affection looks like, my dad is very reserved and not outwardly affectionate at all, so I have no basis of that pure parental love to hold up as the example . I've been in therapy 3 times and I hope I feel more whole sharing my experience here,  I hope it helps with the healing process.   My 2 cousins are heros in my family and I'm the one that can't get it together in life in their eyes. My sister was also a victim but refers to in as childhood curiosity.

136598840398995_141453219913557,"This might sound like a stupid question, but if you carry on sleeping with someone after they raped you, is it really rape? My me too story, I still can't really get my head around it. I need to share it just to find out if what happened was rape, and was it my fault...I stupidly got involved with someone I shouldn't, ten years ago. Now, free and within my right mind, I know that he was manipulative, probably suffered with narcissistic personality disorder, was more than likely a sociopath who wrapped me round his little finger and took complete control of my mind and my body. He hurt me in sexual ways as well as emotional ways and yet I obsessively clung to him like he was more precious than oxygen.We weren't in a relationship and he didn't love me (or even care for me), and I told myself that it was just a bit of fun and I'd not get attached. But obviously, I did.Every time we were together, he did things to me I didn't like and didn't want, and most of the time I just let him because I was desperately obsessed and just to have him in bed with me was enough to make me put up with the bad stuff. But sometimes I said no. He would force me anyway. He would physically restrain me and make me do what he wanted, even if I struggled, begged and sometimes blead. And every time I'd dismiss it and let him convince me what we'd just done was kinky and fun and i'd push it away and bury it.But one time...he wanted to tie me up. He assured me he'd stop if I got scared, so I agreed. Only he didn't stop. He immediately began to use force and I didn't like it. I asked him to stop, I begged him to stop, I began to cry and he wiped the tears off my face and laughed at me. I even tried to fight him off me, but my hands were tied behind my back and he was too strong. I was in agony and I was terrified. All I could do was go limp and hope it would soon be over. But when I stopped crying and struggling, he must have not liked that, because he then flipped me on my back and sat on my chest. He forced himself in my mouth  (I still panic now if someone gets in my face and I can't move).I started panicking again then and tried to fight him off again. I couldn't breathe and it was horrifying!I seem to remember him untying me after a while and finishing in the traditional way. And he held me and kissed me and told me I'm a good girl and that what we'd just done was so kinky and he'd never had a lover as good as me and all that...and in my submissive, mentally tortured state, I let him convince me that what we'd done had been consensual and fun.I carried on sleeping with him for some time, although he never did that to me again.I would say he mentally tortured me over three years. But was this rape? I went back again and again and I know that would never stand up in court. I didn't even entertain the notion it could have been rape until over a year after I was free of him and telling a friend about what he'd done! I was so manipulated I couldn't see what he'd done for a long time after.I'm with a good man now, but what happened to me is still torturing me.

It wasn't easy to make friends at first and since the navy especially at the time was mostly men, all my friends were men. This was in 2005, i was 18 years old. Going off of what i still remember,  they bought beers,  I think it was my first time ever drinking beer. I i dont know how many i had with them but it couldn't have been too many. Anyway, i have always been into art and drawing and somehow it came up and they asked me to go get my art from my barracks room and bring it to one of theirs to hang out and look through it. We did not look through it. I dont remember how i ended up in his bed. But it was like i was frozen. I realized there was another guy facing the bed sitting in a chair, rubbing himself and watching me. I did not know this man. Never seen him before. But he began masturbating while my ""friend"" was rubbing down on me. Eventually, he was having sex with me. He would pull himself out and shove his penis in my face,  rubbing it in my mouth and telling me nasty things. He flipped me over and proceeded to try to get me from behind. He went in for the other hole and i just laid there,  seeing this stranger masturbating to it,  getting used like this, and for some reason i couldnt get away. As he started to push his way in, it hurt so bad. I finally out of nowhere managed to say to stop, it was the strangest thing. I could move suddenly. I told him i didnt want to do that, i got my clothes on,  grabbed my art and walked back to my room. It was on the other side of the base, it was dark and cold, nobody was out from what i could tell. I got to my room and just sat there stairing. I did this for a while everyday after work, trying to figure out what happened to me. What to call it. I always thought rape was violent and the woman had to say no, even when i couldnt i just felt it was my fault. I didnt say no.I never saw either of them again. I still have no clue who the other guy was. This was just one of my experiences, but the worst one. There was a lot of harrassment and innapropiate touching while i finished up my time there.

136598840398995_140633399995539,"This is just one of my experiences. There are others, but for today, I will share just one. I was a Hospital Corpsman in The U.S. Navy. In the late 70's and into the 80's sexual harassment was the norm for women serving in the military. But sexual assault was also common and reporting it was not only discouraged, it often made a bad situation worse for the victim. I was assigned to work in the primary care clinic in the Navy hospital at Camp Pendleton in California. I had an ongoing problem with a male co-worker who was constantly making inappropriate remarks about my body and lewd suggestions. I reported him several times to both my CO and the captain in charge of the clinic. Finally, I was reassigned. A few weeks later, one of my friends who was getting discharged from The Navy had a party at a house off base. I excepted an invitation from a colleague to be his date for the party. We were at the party for about an hour when my date said he wanted to leave. I told him I wanted to stay and he left without me. Shortly after that, I noticed that the man who had been harassing at my job had arrived at the party. I stayed away from him and made small talk with other guests. I did not have much to drink that night, but I do not remember what happened next. I woke up at dawn on the living room floor with my face in the shag carpeting. Before I even opened my eyes I was aware of an excruciating pain in the back of my  head. I rolled over to sit up and saw that the inside seam of my pants was ripped from my knee all the way up to my crotch and down the other side to my other knee. My underwear were ripped out at the crotch. There was no one else in the living room and the bedroom doors were closed. I found my purse and my jacket, which I tied around my waist since my pants were wide open at the seam and my underwear was hanging out. I walked out of the house and after more than an hour of wondering through the sub division, made my way to a main road. The pain in my head was excruciating. Several times I stopped to vomit. I know I had been drugged that night. When I finally got to a grocery store, I called a cab ( it was the eighties, no cell phones). When I made it back to my barracks I got undressed and that's when I saw the bruises on the inside of my thighs. They were in the form of fingerprints down my legs, where they had been forced apart. I could spread my fingers and line them up perfectly with the bruises. There were scratches on my breasts. I have no memory of the rape. I have no idea how many men were involved. Except one man. My tormentor at my duty station went out of his way several times to point at me and whisper in the ears of other men when ever I saw him. In the mess hall. In the hallway. At the barracks.  He would smirk at me and I knew, I just knew, he was the one that drugged and raped me. Other men would smile and laugh, looking at me like I was an object. It was humiliating. But I never reported it. I didn't think it would matter. I guess I felt like I didn't matter. I am much older now. I know my value as a woman and as human being. If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing, it would be ""You Matter. Don't ever let anyone make you feel like you don't matter"".",Deborah Plumb,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=922280111253445&set=gm.140633399995539&type=3,2017-10-24 01:11:37,22,2,0,8,9,0,1,4,0,0

I was so happy to see others sharing that I didn't realize the toll it would take on me personally. When I was 7 years old, myself and my younger brothers would go to a sitters house while my Mom worked. I remember playing outside and loving the yard because there was a huge tree to play under. I don't remember how long we had been going to this sitter but because my Mom worked night shifts, the sitter would bathe us. I was in the bathtub and the sitters husband came in and told me not to look he had to use the bathroom. After he was done he went over to the sink and I remember him being so nice and getting me to get out of the water and come over to him. I remember the bathroom was that puke ugly green color and that the next thing I knew he was trying to rape me. Of course I didn't know that was what he was doing, but when I started crying he stopped and swore me to secrecy. It was so hard to even think about this again. I did report to the local authorities around 25 years after it happened. They found him by the name I gave them and asked for me to fill out a report. Although the statute of limitations had run out, I could be called to testify if someone else was assaulted. I never could bring myself to fill out the report. I guess that haunts me even today. Not knowing if I could have stopped him from hurting someone else. I also have thought a lot about his daughter. He had a little girl and his wife was pregnant at the time. I hope and pray he never hurt them like he did me. I still struggle with this horrific experience EVERYDAY. It was the foundation for all the abuse that was to come. Does anyone else ever feel like if it hadn't happened the first time then maybe the rest wouldn't have either? And tied to this pain is the knowledge that if my sperm donor(Dad) had been at home with us instead of partying while my Mom was working, would this have even happened? It wouldn't be the first time he put me in a situation that ended in sexual violence.",Kathryn Marie West,,status,,2017-10-23 17:37:33,20,6,0,6,8,0,1,5,0,0

I hope it helps someone else even if it is just 1 person. Please come forward, tell us your story., and 3, and 4, and 5, and so on.Some of you know of my story but many of you don’t. This has been a letter in the making for 9 months. I’ve wrote it over and over in my head but never worked up the courage to put it on paper, because somehow it makes it more real. And reliving the events isn’t something I want to do. But the truth is that I relive these events everyday. They affect every decision I make in one way or another. I will not use names or relationships and I will try not to go into to much detail, because these people do not deserve the recognition.Lesson 1:  Let me take you back to a bubbly blonde 9 year old girl. I wasn’t afraid of anything, everyone was my friend. I had on a New Kids On The Block t-shirt that was 20x’s too big, my nightgown. A visitor was over that we have never met before. He gave us a weird vibe and something just wasn’t right. Everyone went to bed except you. You came into my room and carried me into another. You had a towel laid out on the bed. I was still half asleep and not sure what was going on. When I tried to speak you covered my mouth and told me that if I made one sound or ever told anyone that you would kill my family. I laid there as still and quiet as I could. Crying without making a sound. It became clear shortly after you began what the towel was for. When you were done you cleaned yourself and me up told me to go back to bed and you left taking the towel with you to hide the blood. I never saw you again, at least in person anyways. You haunted my dreams though. I silently cried myself to sleep that night asking myself what I did to make that happen. I know now that you taught me a lesson. You taught me that I am willing to do anything and endure anything to protect those that I love.Lesson 2: Jump ahead 2 years. Summer has always been my favorite season. Playing in the sun and water is where I lived. Do you remember the snake game? The one where you all stand in a line and the last person has to swim under all of your legs in 1 breathe? Well I do, except the version I remember is when you would pull your pants down and rub your private on us as you went through. It wasn’t till 3-4 years later that I learned you weren’t doing it to just me but to all the girls we played with. And funny enough we started talking about it while playing the game with you while you were under water. We also discovered that you liked to try and put your hands in our bathing suits while we were driving the jetski or randomly flash us during a shower. Though you were never really physical it still left an impression. You also taught me something. That I can never trust anyone even if I know them closely. And you instilled in me that sex is all that I was good for and that it was ok to let men treat me this way.Lesson 3:  When I was 13, in the middle of all the water games, I liked to go on walks and think when I couldn’t sleep. And at the time that was all the time. One particular night I noticed a street light out and a Green car underneath it. I didn’t think anything of it as that car is always there. While walking by you grabbed me and pulled me into the vehicle. It became clear that you were messed up on something, as you couldn’t complete a coherent sentence and were sweating profusely. I tried to fight you off and tell you to stop but you couldn’t hear me and you were way stronger than me. I gave up. I just laid there until you were done and then I walked back home. Climbed through the window I had snuck out of and took a long hot shower sitting and crying as the water fell on top of me. You helped solidify the idea I had about myself; that all I was good for was sex.My teenage years were not good. I acted out, did drugs, slept around a lot, and did not care who I hurt in the process. When I had my daughter at 20 is when I started trying to turn my life around. From the moment I found out I was pregnant it was like a switch.Lesson 4: In September 2008, right after Ike, I stopped at raceway on my way home from work for cigarettes. Before I could even make it out of my truck 2 guys jumped me. One came through the passenger door and the other through the driver door. I fought and screamed and kicked and scratched to no prevail. The guy in the passenger seat held a knife to my throat while the other ripped my shirt, pulled my skirt up and cut my panties with his knife. I just closed my eyes as tight as I could crying and praying for it you be over soon. When it was all over I closed my door and drove home to my empty apartment with no electricity. You 2 have taught me to always pay close attention to your surroundings and to never trust anyone to save you. The worker at raceway saw the whole thing and did nothing. I went back the next day and asked to see the camera footage, but was told that the cameras were not working because of ike.There are many other inexcusable cases, such as being grabbed randomly by a Chinese guy in the aquarium at the zoo. At first I thought he just accidently brushed up against my boob but when he came back around and grabbed my vagina I knew it was no accident. These things happen everyday right under our noses. It gets ignored and brushed off like it is just a small thing. But all these small things add up. If we keep down playing this behavior when will it ever stop?I am very protective of my children. They know not to ask me to go anywhere in public. One will get excited about something and ask then another will pipe up and say, “No we can’t go. Mom hates people.” It’s sad. I hate that I have turned into this. If, and when, we do go in public I have major panic attacks and constantly count their heads. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1,2, 3, 4 over and over. I have grabbed all 4 of them and pulled them off to the side at the renaissance festival because I saw a huge group of people coming and thrown up in a trash can all while counting them. I am trying to get better about it and think that I have made some improvements. All thanks to counseling, my psychiatrist and medication. But my husband and family are my biggest help, because without them I am nothing.I hope that my story will encourage you to tell your story. Everyone needs to be heard. Everyone needs to understand. And everyone can be the solution.",Heather Rogers,,status,,2017-10-19 14:20:01,24,6,0,7,7,0,2,8,0,0

136598840398995_139974463394766," I lived, like a child, in a home with alcohol and violence. I experienced that I was often not allowed to come home. They locked me out of my home, my mother and my stepfather. I had to find other places to sleep. I used to ask my friends if I could sleep over. I also slept in different basements og om a bud om different attics. Sometimes I had to sleep outside. I got friends that were of the hard types. They said they would take care of me. But they were young boys with hormones and power, so when I was 15, I found that 7 of them abused me on the same evening When I was 15/16, I had moved to a foster home. There began the a foster father to .com in to me at night. He ""just"" stroked my legs and thighs. I was afraid to say something. And pretend I was sleeping. afraid to be thrown out of the cold and to live out again. It happened 6-7 times before I had to tell my then boyfriend about this. I had then tried to take my life with an overdose pill. He moved me home to his parents. When I was 20, I had a party with my two girlfriends - we lived together in the same house. I fell asleep in my bedroom and woke up with a man inside me. which resulted in a pregnancy. I did not report any of the events because I thought this happened because I did not have integrity. I felt worthless and thought I deserved it. I grew up in conditions that were destructive. I was nothing. said little and smiled a lot. afraid of confrontations. 5 years ago I wrote a mini-autobiography, which I published on Facebook. After a while, I was called by the police, who told me I should delete the story. This because the daughter of my foster father and he who made me pregnant was at the police station to report me. Since I had never reported the events, and thus did not have evidence, I would not like to deal with the actual assaults, but about this I had posted this story on a public page, like facebook. I took it away. Now I put this out here in this group. but watch out! Everyone must be prepared to receive threats or reviews. There are evil people out there ....

I can hear your breath as you pant down my neck. As it comes to the second time around, I'm floating away from the horrible place in which I am still trapped in.

Oh really...you're gonna join a group of people whining about what happened to them? What if I get negative feedback or judgment  from schmucks and it makes me turn inward and feel not sufficient enough to speak my truth? Am I weak for joining because after all of these years I should 'have it together' and be 'over it'? Maybe I'm too sensitive and this will dredge up too many emotions I have learned to 'try' to bury."" Again, this is what my mind played out....but these weren't MY thoughts. These are the imposed thoughts of a society that doesn't want to be reminded of how messed up things can be. These are the thoughts that one acquires and endures because the secrecy of being violated creates an endless rabbit hole of insecurity and questioning of oneself. But guess what? I have found this site to be most cathartic and isn't it so nice to know there's a place to share where others 'get it'? So I say, keep the page.

She tried to teach me how to be careful and not to trust anyone easily.One day, I was nearly 10 years old, I was walking down the street, her hand in mine, and a man looked at my legs while he was walking. It was quite stressing, I turned back my head and he was still looking at my skirt. She explained me why. It scared me.At 12, she teached me what a rape is. This conversation made me stronger than my school’s friends which were so ignorants !During all my childhood, I had to face many time the very same old creepy situations in the bus, street, train... like it was normal for everyone around me ! and my first time was a mess, forced to do something I wasn’t ready for just because I was 15, I was quite drunk and so was him, he justified his act in his head just like that : she drunk too much vodka, she stayed in the woods with me when everybody has left, I have to shag her, that’s correct right ? Just as some of you girls, I thought I was just good for sex when guys stared at me at this time. Party all the time, drugs, alcohol, more dirty episodes, probably in order to pass over it in a corner of my head. Now, I’m happy with a good guy who doesn’t see the world like these assholes, he makes my happiness every single day since 5 years and I do not think like that anymore.

We were both sleeping in the pull out bed in the basement. Her father was very strict & my friend was afraid of him. When we heard him coming down the stairs we pretended to be asleep. He proceeded to come to my side of the bed and sat down. He took my hand and put it on his penis. I knew it wasnt right, I tried to nudge my girlfriend (his daughter!!) but she actually fell  asleep!! Eventually I started to wiggle like I was waking up and scared him away. Mind you  before this day he would play hid & seek in the dark at his mother in laws house and grope my breasts. BUT my story really starts here: Next day I told my friend, she didn't believe me, she ran and told her parents. HE proceeded to yell at me in front of my girlfriend and his wife how I was making up lies and that if I continued I would go to jail. They just stood there and said nothing. I went home and never told a soul, not even my mother. 40 years later I committed to write a chapter in a book called ""Transformations for Women"" and while I was deciding to figure out what to write, my girlfriend found me on FB and sent me a message, about it's been 25 yrs since we spoke how was everything. It made me realize that God wanted me to write about this story, so we connected and at the end of catch up, I blindsided her and asked her about that night. She told me that she struggled with it her whole life, her parents divorced and when she was older, her mother told her that secretly she believed me! It was so releasing to heat that and I knew why even though i didn't see myself as a writer I was being called to do so. I found healing without writing one word! God works in miracles! It ultimately lead me to do the work I do today. I facilitate Women's Circles where we get to be seen, heard, respected & loved. As a coach, I never considered myself a healer but with these circles women find their calm confidence to speak truth and use their voice. I am not allowed to post any links but if you are curious to know, private message me. Thanks for letting me share in a public forum. From 10-16 I had too many situations involving, my ex-brother-in-law, my next door neighbor, a school friends grandfather and then I worked on Wall St at a high level...need I say more... PS.

I have a few stories that are relevant but the one I'm willing to share publicly is this:2013, deployed at sea. I was working in the mess decks/galley at that time. My LPO (supervisor) seemed like a cool dude at first. He had a sense of humor, he wasn't super strict most of the time, wife and two kids back home. I didn't mind working for him. Then the comments started. And the blatent, head tilted, staring at my breasts while I tried to talk to him about work related issues. And then came the suggestions that we could get away with ""it"" after I was promoted to E-4 because he was an E-5 and it wouldn't technically be fraternizing (but really it still would be). There was hardly a conversation with him that didn't somehow turn to him being a total creep. I denied his advances but to no avail. I started talking to my peers about it. My other co-workers were all males but they too were being harassed and assaulted by him. When they sat at the tables with conjoined benches, he would prop one leg on the bar and rest his genitals on their backs. The first time, we laughed. Fuck it, we were in the military. We have crude humor. But then it became a daily thing, several times a day. We told him to stop. He didn't. Even when the guys would be obviously angry about it. He even went so far as to grab a male sailors crotch as they passed by each other in a doorway. I talked to more females who worked the mess decks in other areas. I wasn't the only woman he had made comments to. There were so many. So many other women told me he said the same things to them. Why? Why didn't anyone say anything? This had been going on for so long. Snitches get stitches. Nobody wanted to be the tattle tale. We are conditioned from a young age to suck it up, ignore it, pretend it doesn't actually matter. All because nobody likes a tattle tale. Not only does that idea foster bullies, it fosters sexual abusers and harassers. Hell, it took me weeks to report him and I wouldn't even do it face to face... I had a male friend leave a comment card that I had written in my female master cheif's mail box. The next day everything exploded. I was brought in for questioning. God, I was so nervous. Would they believe me? Was what he was doing enough for them to take action? I hardly worked the next few days because I had to tell so many different people what was happening.It turns out that it was enough to take action. He was off the ship in 2 weeks, and when you're at sea, that's a really impressive feat. I'm proud of how my chain of command responded. NOT ONCE DID ANYONE ASK ME IF I BROUHT IT ON! But that is not the case for many women and men who are assaulted or harrased. That's why I was scared to speak up. Rape culture is not something that liberal feminists made up. All of this happened in plain sight. But my chain of command was oblivious until I spoke out. We need to stand together against this kind of behavior. So please, if you see something, say something.

I will NEVER forget it. He touched me in ways and places no man should EVER touch a child. I was shown some of the most file things in magazines. I was so confused and hurt....but didn't understand why. When I finally told and said something, my Grandmother begged my Mom NOT to report him because it would 'shame the family'. I went through YEARS as a pre teen and teen not understanding what happened, or knowing that getting my cousin 'in trouble' was not my fault. I carried that for years even into my first marriage. When I found out that I was pregnant with my first daughter, I because so afraid and depressed, because what if someone hurt her like he hurt me. Finally I got the therapy that was LONG overdue and am every day becoming completely healed.

I first came up with this song a few months later after my assailant tried to contact me to invite me to go dancing. I flew into a rage and buried myself in my room.

I’ve been sitting on it since then, not really sure what to do with it, until the  hashtag appeared on Social Media and I realized it was time to tell my story. I put the finishing touches on it yesterday night and recorded it one go. There are still some rough patches but it’s the first original song I’ve written that I’m proud of and that means a lot to me. The alternate title was going to include the name of my assailant, but considering I still run into them around town all the time, I decided I’m still not ready for any potential backlash I could get for going public, especially on social media. I left a blank instead, both to symbolize the silence around sexual violence, and so that other survivors can also relate to the song. I also left three 8 bar breaks in case any other survivors want to collaborate with instrumentals, percussion, vocals, spoken word, rap.

I swore I could see him breathing.. So I got out! I went outside for a walk. This was my town, Valley Stream. The funeral home was around the corner from the post office, that was across the street from our bank, that was around the block from our favorite pizza place. This was a part of town I knew well, it was a Monday or Tuesday afternoon, broad daylight. So there was, walking across the train station parking lot when an LTD load of boys drove by. The one in the front passenger seat had a head of bushy brown hair, leaned out the open window and said;""Hey little girl, why don't you lift up your dress , so I can lick between your legs?""I remember how I could hear the laughter from the guys in the back seat.

Old men telling me they'd like to take me home or telling me I'd make a good house wife. Just little slips or disturbing things to make your skin crawl.Working the night shift I had three guys come in at surround me at work. The leader, I guess, started talking to me like ""hey baby"" and ""I had a wet dream about you last night. Wanna hear it?"" I was alone. No one to help me and I was scared. I said no and found a break away point were I could get to the back. Everytime i see a group of men at work I try to get somewhere else. Somewhere were they can't get me. The fear is real and it's not outside on the street or at a bar. It's at work. At a grocery store. So everyone saying that the place you are at causes fear has no grounds. One of the janitors at my night shift job was very disgusting to. He's make comments about sex jokes or anything innaproriate. I didn't say anything for awhile. Then he started harassing the other young girls at my work too. He's take pictures of them. To one of the girls he even said that she'd look better if she was naked. Like what do you even say to that? Me and some of the girls he was harassing banned together and told our story to many managers. One of the managers went back and told the guy that he couldn't say those things and then told him who we were. We felt like we had a target on our back. Scared about being alone at night. The janitors remakes only got worse. He told another male coworker that he bet I taste like strawberries. I assume he thought it was funny do to my strawberry blind hair. The male coworker was disgusted. He told me and helped file another complaint. We finally got a manager who would listen and report the events officially to HR. The janitor was fired. It took two years for someone to listen. Let's talk about just going out to get food at taco bell. My friend dropped some taco on her leg and it was summer so she was in shorts, only about 16 at the time. A man sitting a table away leaned over and said ""why don't you have your boyfriend lick that up"" There were no guys there. She didn't even have a boyfriend at that time. She felt uncomfortable and left shortly after. How about at my gas station job guys will come in asking to take me home with them. How do you respond? No thank you. And then they get mad like why wouldn't you. This isn't something happening every now and then. It's almost every day.

If people are worried they can do their research and see what’s been happening. As always it is all public for everyone to see.. that’s what we want! People to seeSO NO MORE!!! SHARE AND GATHER YOUR SISTAS....Reply to all posts about selling stories or fake pics with the emoji for solidarity or strength 💪🏿✊🏻 no words no justification just strength. They will keep trying but if we can hold firm they will not win. Anyone with real concerns will look over what we have posted and get the answers and understanding they needs the last posts accusing us have been from fake profiles.. so no more apologising or feeding these people... Just ... ✊🏻 or 💪Do we get it? Shall we do this??? Let’s go!!!,Angel Sam Pattison-O'Brien,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1756288521341775&set=gm.140275420031337&type=3,2017-10-22 16:01:45,26,7,0,19,6,0,1,0,0,0
136598840398995_140282366697309,Hi .I joined this group and posted # me too .to help show the enormity of the problem...  .I am one of the lucky ones . I had counselling  and also was in a group for survivors of sexual abuse . This was an amazing help . I feel I was lucky as I don't think there are to many groups like this country wide . It was completely confidential . And we all trusted each other.  Sadly that group has now been disbanded . But  I had previously left .as I felt I was ready to leave .  I still came out kind of public with me too . But felt unsure about doing so . I have moved on . Have made amazing friends through the group .   But the feeling of not being believed will all ways hurt .  So I had help and make the most of every moment I have now .  . Someone contacted me from this group on messenger but I did not reply and the link has gone . So sorry I missed that ....hence my long text now .

It’s your group...Do we need to change the name of the group so it invites everyone to take a look maybe?

136598840398995_139023340156545,"When I was eighteen, my foolish ass was on the streets of SLC, UT, running amok, in doleful pursuits of discovering myself. The first night of my being on the streets, three guys approached me. They asked me my name and I suppose I must have asked their names as well, though I have zero recollection of it. The unfortunate thing is that I was extremely high off of a vicious drug called spice. If any of you know what that drug is, you know from the start that my night would already be on a road of deterioration. I got in the car with them, blissfully unaware of my fate in a few short hours. I will refrain from delving into the gruesome details, but long story short, I smoked more, they made me drink something, I don't know what it was, and I fell in and out of consciousness. I woke up a few times during the heinous actions of my perpetrators-there were three for certain, though more guys were in the hotel room so who really knows for sure? Due to my inebriation, I blamed myself. If I hadn't done the drugs, ran away from home, this never would have happened. But God has helped me tremendously through my healing process and He reminded me that through my pain, I would help others. Pain in this life is inevitable. But I constantly tell myself that it is bigger than just me. I go around sharing this story and others to reach those in the darkness and agony; asking why such an awful thing would take place in your life, in hopes of showing you that hope indeed still exists.Stay up, my friends. ❤",Kaiya Jean Rogers,,status,,2017-10-19 11:17:33,10,0,0,6,2,0,1,1,0,0

136598840398995_139978870060992,"It's two a.m. and I'm seventeen; two days before graduation, just walking home from work. I consider taking a shortcut but know not to walk in the dark, so I stay in the light, I stay in the light, but in the light I can feel him watching me as I try to navigate home. I can feel him watching me and there's no escape. No matter what I do. I'm all alone on this road. My intuition is confirmed when I hear his footfalls coming closer behind me and I try to just be but soon we're walking in tandem and then he's walking right next to me. My thoughts are chanting, ""I'm falling prey, I'm falling prey,"" I can only pray that he isn't after me as he walks in faster unison; in unison with me. My first mistake comes when I try to be polite since making conversation does little to delay my plight. The weather and wellness are far from his mind as his left hand hand grabs the nape of my neck and the other brings a knife to my throat's lifeline. He tells me what he wants and his words stir like a dark spell in my mind. He tells me what he wants and I try to negotiate and be polite, be polite, My God, I'm being fucking polite while he guides me deeper into the nightmare limelight. Our scuffle finds the center of the street and I can see the dark ditch where my ruin awaits. It awaits. At knifepoint. At knifepoint. I'm being led to my demise at fucking knifepoint. Lost. Bewildered. And scared. I'm only getting deeper into his zone. And then at the bottom of the road, there's a glimmer, a glimmer, a mere little shimmer of hope. The skin of police cruiser comes into the light and slowly coasts on by. We both stop struggling and stand in stillness staring at the bottom of the road. In the middle of the street under the glow of the streetlamp, there I am, forgetting how to scream as the cruiser just coasts on by. I just stand with my mouth agape and a only voiceless breath escapes. It's up to me now, the law isn't on my side. In the ghetto, under the street lamp, in the middle of the street the law isn't on my side and it's me, a ditch, a knife, and a rapist with me in his determined grasp. My mind races ahead to yellow tape and me face down; my lifeless body in the daylight; people standing around. I try to escape the jean jacket that's buttoned at my chest. It's hindering my great escape. Oh and I need to escape. I need this miracle to happen right now. I need to free myself from this straightjacket. And he realizes I'm about to slip out of his grasp and rips my silk jumper along the zipper that caresses my back to get to my flesh and I can feel the night air fall upon my exposed skin. And then I become something I've never known myself to be. And I am everything that he is not. I am everything he thought I forgot. I am everything that he really fears. I am everything that he really fucking fears. And from the depths of places I never knew emerged a primal rage that happily sprung from its hidden cage. I locked eyes with my assailant and found the depths of his sorry soul, grabbed the blade with my hand and let it cut my palm as I gripped it harder and harder and pulled him closer to greet the rage of my face; screaming a scream that erupted from my ancient core right into his bewildered gaze as I grabbed his poor excuse of a member and squeezed with all of my might. I threw him, his knife, and his bullshit back. YES. I threw him, his knife, and his fucking bullshit back. I wasn't what he thought I was. No. I wasn't the prey he thought I was. I turned and let the beast go back to sleep as I ran barefoot along the yellow lines all the way home. I regained my composure running…running all the way home. I stayed in the light. I stayed in the light. And this time I was the light. I silently climbed the stairs to my floor, pushed the brass key into the lock, turned it, and quickly found the sanctuary of my room while everyone slept. On my desk, I found a newspaper clipping from my father whose headline read, ""Ways to Escape Rape."" It's 3 a.m. and I'm seventeen, two days before graduation.

136598840398995_138960313496181,"I am copy pasting my  story here... rather than re-write it. This was what I posted on my wall the other day.... Age 4 or 5... raped on a kitchen table by, not sure who, as the details have been blanked out of my memory. I remembered for a day, but it was too traumatic, so it went back into repression. Partly, because my boyfriend at the time, did not react very kindly to my middle of the night terror when I remembered and relived it in a great detail. Age 8 to 16- sexual abuse by my step father, pretty much groping me and worse every chance he got, even if it was just a minute of no other adults in the room, I was not safe from sexual touch or being ordered to touch him sexually. Age 14,,, got pregnant by step dad... miscarried a few weeks later, never went to the Dr, cause that would have outed him... I almost died, and was accused of prostitution.Age 12... fondled by a foster home father, in front of his wife... she laughed and said, ""Don't you like it?"" That same guy used to come into my room, and make me shower and dress in front of him. Tried to press charges, but nothing was ever done, other than move me to another home. I don't even think they stopped sending kids to that ""home"". Age 18, raped by a needly junky, who had given me a place to sleep on his couch, as I was homeless and saving for a place. Then blackmailed out of pressing charges, and was laughed at by the cops. After that I turned to drugs and had a totally mental breakdown leading to a few days of sitting in a corner crying uncontrollably, unable to speak, eat, or sleep. Age 20, raped by some drug dealer my friend was hanging out with.Age 31 or 32... raped by my then live in boyfriend... who told me, as I balled under him, ""I;ll be done in a minute... just shut up. Took me over a decade to admit that was rape.There is more... and I am not alone. This is why the  thing is so important. I have had family disown me, step dads family still thinks I am a lair and a homewrecker, and he is dead and it has been close to 3 decades since I blew the whistle on him. I have been laughed at by the cops, Had the state refuse to press real charges, had more relationships fall apart because of all this than I care to count. I have self view issues that are still pretty freakin bad... BUT I am survivor... my story matters, and it is REAL, every bit of it... I wish I were alone, as NOBODY deserves this shit... One day I'll write an auto-biography, and very well may lose a lot of people in my life, as I plan for it to be honest... but I feel like the veil needs to be taken down, we NEED to address this very real, and very large issue.And if you say ANYTHING about the way a woman (or man)dresses, acts, or looks as if it is an excuse... just don't. It won't end well. You could be the hottest man alive walking naked down the street, drunk, and drugged out, and I would not rape you... because I am not a fucking rapist. And if I saw a rape in progress, I would put my very life on the line to stop it, weather I know you or not.",Jamaica Russo,,status,,2017-10-19 08:56:05,44,8,1,9,8,0,2,23,2,0

I never spoke of this incident because I was afraid and ashamed. Then in my own home, unknown to my mother who was suffering with alcoholism, I endured  frequent sexual ""psychological"" harassment from a trusted older male family member. I endured this harassment from the time I was 12 to 15 years old. I had the strength to say ""no, you will not make me do what you want me to!""  I also had mastered a way of finding  places to spend large blocks of  my weekend time. I felt safe when I was outside my home. I'd spend time in  church or I'd  pursue my musicial activities.

So here I go.I was 17 years old and working a great job at a local museum.   It was 3 people working everyday there ( The director, a retired handyman, and myself).  It was a small group.  It was a normal day, and I was doing some work at this big table.  The Director was away on business, so I was working on an upcoming event.  While I was working, the other employee came into the kitchen.  We chatted like normal nothing different.  He came over to where I was sitting and looked over my shoulder.  I thought he was looking at something I was working on.  Next thing I know, his hand was touching my left breast.  I just froze.  What do you do?  I could have said no, but it wouldn't come out of my mouth.  He just left afterwards.  I think I just tried to shake it off and keep working, but these thoughts of what happened and what do I do came in.  I began to worry about my job.  I loved working there.  Would the director believe me over him?  So I said nothing to no one.  What people don't understand is this just doesn't go away.  I put up a bigger wall then I already had.  I only let people get so close, then that's it.  I even kept my husband at a distance.  I struggled for years being around older men.  Now that I'm 38 and going through therpy, I'm getting better.

136598840398995_139255286800017,"I am a former employee, who worked at the independent federal government agency. I was sexually assaulted over several years by several men, harassed, and bullied by females also. I did not want to play the game of kissing ass and fucking my way through the agency to be promoted. I thought if work hard to proved myself as an asset that I would be promoted. I received exceptional to high performance appraisal. Took every class my female supervisor told me to take because I thought if worked hard and I did what I was told I would be promoted. But was not promoted and they treated me like garbage. My first three years at the agency was great. My director from 1998 – 2001 was very protective of me and he did not let people abuse or use me at the agency. But because of political reasons he was forced out and he warned me to be careful and not to trust anyone. I should have left but I decided to stay because I was pregnant with another baby on the way. In 2001 my nightmare started, new political appointees were brought into the office and I was being watched everyday. This man harassment start insistently, he would stand behind me everyday watching me. I tried getting along with him by being cordial, answering questions, and doing the work he asked of me, but he became physically abusive as years went on. When we were in the office alone I was on guard more so, he began rubbing his privates on me and was holding me up against my desk in my cubicle. I was struggling to get away from him and finally got away and went up under my desk. He ran away and I should have reported him then but I did not. I finally had enough when he forced his self on me again, I blacked out and then I woke up with this man trying to drag me into room behind my cubicle. I grabbed on to the doorway and would not let go so he gave up, let me go, and he ran back to his office. I decided to do an EEO complaint against him because he was going to rape me if I did not do something. I worked there too long and should left but didn’t. The females were horrible bullies, they would harass me just for thinking and just being me. I put up with the madness at this agency because I learned that my family severely abuse me so I had to just survive. So I did same at this agency, when the harassment and the bullying  from women became to much to bare I resigned from my position.",MeMe Austin,,status,,2017-10-19 22:21:26,12,4,0,6,2,1,1,2,0,0

136598840398995_139586743433538,"Just so everyone knows; lately I have realized that we have mentally sick people in this world, those who somehow justify molesting and abusing women and girls. I had no idea there were so many women and girls who experienced this until recently. To the women, you don't deserve that, and they are not justified. To the men, I know there are men who do not tolerate this, and I know there are those who somehow commit wrongful acts. The good news is there are many good men, who will not stand idly by, such as myself, and allow such actions, and who will prosecute the guilty. It's unfortunate women feel like they can't dress up beautifully, without being wary of this societal disease. Women shouldn't have to feel like they need to protect themselves. It is the responsibility and moral obligation of men to protect, provide, lead, and put an end to such awful behavior. For now I will be more cognizant about this issue, and if I encounter such behavior, I will use my power and authority to prosecute, by the strength of our legal system, my intuition, and physical dominance. The good men have more power, there are more of use, and we have the ability to end this hideous crime. To the women, please don't hide it when something like this happens, yet be wise with whom you tell first. It is not your fault this happened. You are worthy of love, respect, and protection. #IWill stand up. WHERE ARE ALL OF THE GOOD MEN STANDING UP FOR WOMEN, GIRLS, MEN, AND BOYS, WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS? It's baffling to me that I mostly see women standing up for this cause on social media and real life, yet I don't see a lot of men standing up for this. If you men cannot stand up for women, protect them, treat them as equals, and support women through this horrid issue, then you are not a real man, and you should be ashamed of yourself. Stand up for those who have gone through this. Let's put an end to this. ",Floren Lyrical,,status,,2017-10-20 14:43:21,19,10,3,11,7,0,1,0,0,0

Sexual invasion is one of the most damaging of abuses us women can endure.. some of us never recover and even when you are strong enough to lift up and stand up .. the invasiveness becomes part of your story.. even if you never share it . it is still a part of your story because you cannot hide from yourself..You walk but you wonder if others can see.... you try to find new ways to bring completion to your being... you look in the mirror and wonder 'am i good enough..always measuring yourself against some yarstick of personal growth that you tell yourself you ought to be at.. For some we look at others and measure cloths. and other material possessions as a benchmark of 'perhaps if i did what they did I would be further' .. then there is the sense that you are just moving through time but not really progressing...Sexual invasion of your spiritual being robs you of your true spiritual self...your true spirit being.. its will cements itself into your heart and gut... It took me a long time understand the true intent of such invasivness.. its not that I am weak or something it wrong with me or perhaps i did this or that correct it wont come after me.. the true intent of sexual invasion is to rob your spirit of will and purpose, to bring you into subjection of someone else sense... that robbed me of so much that I just cannot hold back anymore...

I'm too good for that. Some of you will know what I am talking about in some or all of these descriptions. Some of you know the people that were involved in these scenarios. Some of you love those people. That is okay. Everybody is loved by somebody. DO NOT READ FURTHER if you think it will upset you to remember these things. Take responsibility for what you allow yourself to read and absorb. I am simply stating what has happened *to me* and this is *my story* in a nutshell.***1] When I was not yet a teenager, a trusted loved one allowed two men to have sex with me. That was the first time I was physically 'intimate' with anybody.2] When I was in junior high, I was walking home at night and was forced into sexual acts by a boy from the same junior high. I told a couple of friends and they didn’t believe me. 3] When I was fifteen years old, I lost my virginity to a man who was twenty-two. He offered me weed, and I tried it, but I was not physically or mentally incapacitated when I slept with him. It was in his mother's garage, and everybody who knew about it was fine with it. Until my dad found out and got a restraining order against him.4] Less than 24 hours after losing my virginity at fifteen to that man, a trusted male friend I attended high school with listened to me cry about it. I had forgotten my sleeping pills and was staying at a friend's house. He gave me a xanax, claiming it was the same thing, and later slept with me after I'd smoked weed and drank booze. I remember none of it. When I accused him of rape, all of our mutual friends took his side.5] Less than a month after that happened, I was dating a boy and sleeping with him actively. One night when we were all drunk, he allowed a friend to 'join' us. The next day everybody in our school knew about it and made fun of me for being 'tag teamed'. 6] When I was eighteen years old I was drunk and a drunk man pushed himself on me. I said no, he continued, and I did not fight him off. Another friend walked in on us, and weeks later when I said he'd forced himself on me I was again called a liar and a slut. This argument went on between mutual friends for nearly a decade. Sometimes I still hear about it.7] When I was 21 years old, I was drunk and a man took advantage of me. He was stone cold sober. I could not come forward to authorities because he was just under eighteen and his father threatened me with statutory rape.8] When I was 21 years old, later that same year, I was at a bar. My energy drink (non-alcoholic because that mattered to NCIS and the cops) was drugged. I left the bar knowing something was wrong, and was attacked outside of it, thrown against a car, and raped. I had a black eye, a sprained wrist, bruises all over my body, a ripped dress and injuries I don't want to publicly disclose. The cops and PMO and NCIS accused me of making it up because I felt guilty for sleeping with somebody else, I was married.9] The following took place when I was ages 23-25. Throughout the course of a two year relationship with an older man, I was forced to do things with him sexually in front of other men and participate in sexual acts I did not want to do and was not comfortable performing in order to satisfy his kinks and his closet bisexualism.I used to have a hard time telling people these things. I felt like I was 'admitting' to things I had done wrong. That is how victims are made to feel. We also get told that a 'victim mentality' gets us victimized ten fold, and that we need to bring ourselves out of it. I did not ask for these things to happen to me. I did not deserve them. NOBODY does.These are the instances where I have been full on, physically made to take part in sexual acts or sexual intercourse against my will or when I was not able to consent. I said 'no' to some of these men. I said nothing to others. This does not include the countless times men have put their hands on me to ask to 'read my tattoos', taken advantage of me being very close to them while caring for them in hospitals or on an ambulance, screamed obscenities at me while I was working ocean rescue in a bikini or talked disgustingly to me while I was working alongside them, in the same uniform, at the fire department.This does not include, likewise, the times that I likely made men feel like I was giving them unwanted attention or sexualizing them. There was a period of time that I was trying to 'take back my sexuality' and I more than likely made some men feel like they had to be intimate with me to get my positive attention.This is a human issue. So,  and #MenToo and #IHaveBeenGuiltyToo and please, please remember: People you know and love have perpetrated this and been victim to this all the same.Wake up. Change.

All I knew was that it made me feel uncomfortable and I do not like it. A lot.I told my mom about it, seeking for a validation for my feelings. Instead, I was told that it was my own fault and not to bring it up again as it creates an awkward situation between the adults.So I pushed my feelings down, wrapped it up, and place it in a dark corner of my mind, with the intention to bury it with other forgotten memories. Of course, it never gets buried for long.As I was growing up, I see and hear similar incident from books, magazines, news ... and obtained the validation I was looking for. The fact that ideally, it should not happened. The fact that bottom line is, it is not right. The fact that I should not be blamed and penalized for something that was not my fault to begin with. Thank you .Bringing it up to my mom to achieve some closure, I was told that the reason why I am bringing it up to the surface again is due to my inability to see the bigger picture that requires me to pretend nothing ever happened.  That I possess selfishness for not willing to make a sacrifice for a greater good, keeping the family together.Bringing it up to my friends, some told me I should not waste my time to talk about it as there is no point talking about the past. I should just move on. Some told me that I am just trying to get some attention for airing something that is embarrassing.

136598840398995_138118010247078,Not sure Im ready to go in to full detail I was abused sexually from the age 3 till 13 from multiple family members all who I trusted and several friends of family I did not know what was happening was wrong I knew that it hurt me but didn't know that it was wrong I though that's these people loved me and i didn't know any better that this isn't what people do who love you I finally came to my sister and to discover that she was also abused Starting also about age 3 till about 14 by some of the same people she then taught me that it wasn't ok and that i needed to tell some one so we did i was slapped and told it was my fault and the abuse continued year after year i began to think it was my fault and that I deserved because i wasn't a good little girl wasn't till about 14 I met a amazing lady who told me it wasn't and I deserved justice but when my family found out they didn't want me to come forth cause they didn't want their family problems and made sure I couldn't have any contact with the lady after that I was in hospitasl for mental care one after another for flash backs and other issues I think that what hurts the most is knowing that I wasn't worth protecting that they didn't care enough to protect me and only a daily basis sent back with my abuses after they knew what they had been doing to me  In my heart I forgave my parents Do I forgive my abusers Im still not sure I want to cause I don't want hate in My heart and they will have to face God in the end I think I would confront them to let them know the hurt they cause Mentally Physically and Emotionally it will always haunt me affect my life I try not to let it control me but certain smells touch movement small thing bring it all back Im not sure I will ever be able to over come that but I do know that I refuse to let them win I will REMAIN STRONG and I will always protect my children and make sure they know it isn't ok and MOM will always protect them,Heather Marie Vazquez,,status,,2017-10-17 16:12:50,4,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0

Went from that marriage to another vile marriage where I was also verbally abused and cheated on. I was also full of bitterness. That lasted almost 5 years. During this time I had turned to addictions, pills, anything that would help me sleep. During this time I had also tried to overdose and kill myself 36 times. But God. Yes I said but GOD.

I saw the ""known molester of children that no one ever reported to police"" around her -- I got this GUT INSTINCT to go get her.  But the ""Christian"" brainwash I had been programmed with at that time told me ""NO... he has been forgiven of his sins and it's been two years -- so don't make a scene"".    On the way home that night she told me she had something to tell me.   When she told me he pulled her into a room at the church and put his hands all over her -- I felt SICK.   I DIDN'T LISTEN !!!   Needless to say -- he messed with wrong kid because he was arrested the next day/ spent ONLY ONE night in jail.   Mommy and Daddy got their 27 year old son OFF with just 2 years probation.   I made sure the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints excommunicated him (which should have been done after the 1st child he touched).   BUT -- 5 years later the LDS church allowed him to be re-baptized even though I sent a strong letter of protest.   Then I understand a few years later -- he was arrested again for molesting.   The charge that he faced for my daughter was ""Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor""  (REALLY?) but the next time it was as a sexual predator.

Maybe because my mom told me many times that I never should talk to or go with a stranger. Maybe I was just lucky. When I was 8 years old and walking home from school a man drove by and pulled over a cupple of meters from where I was standing. He asked for directions. I took a few step closer to the car and then he opened the door. His pants were down and he was masturbating. I was shocked and terrified and started to run the other way, home. I was afraid that he would come after me and drag me in to his car. He didnt. Maybe I was just lucky. When I was 12 years old and started develop some of the boys started touching my breasts as a Hello. They talked about how much they had growned (or not) and compared them with other girls like it was a normal subject of conversations and they laught. It felt so bad but I didnt say anything. When I was 15 years old I stood in line at a carneval to take a ride on one of the attractions. All of a sudden an older man came up from behind, wrapped his arms around me, lifted me up in the air, against his body and whispered in my ear: I love to run naked in rubberboots. I tried to get down, get him off me and asked him to put me down but he didnt listen. No one around me reacted. Finally he put me down and left. Me and my friend laughted about it even thou it wasnt funny, cause what else would we do? When I was 16 years old me and my soccerteam went to a huge soccercompetition in Gothenburg. We were all very excited. We slept in a classroom at a school and there were lots of other teams staying there as well. One evening after me and two of my teammates had brushed our teeth in the hallway, about ten boys from a team surrounded us. We stood in the middle of this cirkle of boys and they were touching us wherever they could lay their hands and they were laughing. One of the boys forced me to kiss him. He stuck his tounge in my mouth. We said stop but they didnt listen. After a while they let us go. Our coaches talked to the management. We were shipped off to a hotel for the night but first they made us follow them to the boys room where they wanted us to point out the boys who did it. We were still in shock and the boys laughed and made a spectical of it. Then the management explained to us that we had to think how we dressed because boys are boys. The next day we were back at the school. The boyteam were still there and no actions against what hd happened were taken. When I was 18 and walking home a car with 4 men stopped beside me and they asked how much money I would like to have to fuck them. I answered in shock that I wasnt a prostitute, I didnt want to have sex with them. They drove off. There are so many more stories of sexually harassment but I'm so thankful that I haven't been raped. Yet. You'll never know, maybe I someday run out of luck. That is so fucking awful that I, and I guess many women with me live in a world where that is something to feel thankful for. That women always have to have that thought in the back of our heads. That we can't feel safe. That we always take procausion when we go out. That we avoid things that can put us in a situation who gets out of control. I have a 12 year old daughter. I want her to grow up in a world where she doesnt have to worry about these kind of things.

Let me start by saying I am not good with punctuation so please forgive me.So without going into every little detail I will just sum it up the best I canI was abused sexually by 3 people. The first was my biological father. I  want to say I was around 7 or 8 . My oldest sister was his first victim. He would come get her from bed and then send her to get me when they were finished. My mom worked nights and so she was not home when this happened. It got to a point that he was no longer getting my older sister first in fact she was not even being called to his room it became me more and more. She eventually told a friends mother about HER being abused and they arrested him. She was put in a home for awhile and me and my sister ( she had a mental disability) were questioned repeatedly. I denied everything I still remember to this day almost 40 years later knowing that if I told they would take me from my mom too and I was not admitting to anything. He was sentenced to prison. My mother moved us away from the house that it had happened in and moved us to an apartment. She had custody of my older sister back and she baby sat us while my mom worked 2 jobs to keep us feed clothed and a roof over our heads. My oldest sister began sexually abusing me I want to say we lived in the apartment about 6 months before it started my grand father helped my mom move us from the town we lived in and moved us to another town which made I feel the abuse worse because then my mom was gone even more because of her commute to work and back (larger town longer drives). My sister continued her abuse on me for about 2 years. Until my mother moved us back to our old town and moved in with a man she had been seeing over the last year.The abuse with my sister stopped I was about 11 at this time. The man my mom would soon marry was supposed to be someone that would make a change in our lives. He was very physically abusive and mentally abusive and then as I got older about 13 he started sexually abusing me as well. He had adopted me and my sistersI never told anyone until my daughter was born and then I told my now ex husband ONLY because I freaked out when I walked in and he was changing our daughters diaper and I lost it. He then told my mother in which I told her of ONLY the first incident. She cherished my adoptive father and with her health issues I just could not tell her. I figured I was married I was away from him so I would be ok. She passed away only knowing of my biological fathers abuse. My biological father passed away in prison right after I had gotten married he had been sentenced to 20 years for abusing another child after he was released on probation for my sisters abuse. My adoptive father passed away in 97. My older sister destroyed my first marriage was always calling Child Welfare on me and my ex husband and was always causing problems in our family as a whole. When my mother passed she moved away which was a blessing but I wanted to confront her on what she had done to me. So I went to visit her and was going to be a grown up and talk to her. I walked into her house (in which was right across the street from where HER abuse started.) She had a shrine dedicated to my biological father candles pictures of him it was horrible when I questioned her she said "" my son has a right to know who his grandpa was"" I left her home and we did not speak for many years when we did speak again she took some personal things from my home while I was out doing an errand. So I wrote her a letter and sent it to her via messenger on facebook confronting her not only with the theft but also the abuse she put me through as a child. She blocked me and we have not spoken. Our middle sister passed away in 2016 my aunt told me I needed to put my hatred for my oldest sister away while I was standing there watching my middle sister pass NOT A TIME TO start this with me I went off on my aunt and my entire mother side of my family that was there found out about what my older sister did to me. No one said a word. Now when I am around they do not mention her name if they do they get told that as far as I am concerned she belongs in hell with the other 2. So basically that is my story in a nutshell. I chose to be a survivor many years ago after I was able to escape the last abuse. I made a vow that I would not allow the abuse to define me. I would stand up and make sure this did not happen to any other child I was around.",Ronda Miller,,status,,2017-10-19 19:52:42,15,1,0,4,6,0,0,5,0,0
136598840398995_139055360153343,"Hiya there everyone xFirst of all, I think this is a fantastic idea, for everyone to share their stories so their confidence can grow, they can vent in a safe and constructive place/way and be reminded of of the fact that they are by no means alone in their suffering.On to my story; it began when I was too young to remember. All I know is that the abuse ended when I was somewhere between 9 and 10.There were two predators; the first a woman, who my earliest memories were among my first, when I was only 3 years old.The second was a man that I'm pretty sure she sold me to (she used to go upstairs with him sometimes herself and when they returned I remember money being exchanged.) Again, I can't remember when the abuse started with him as it was such a young age, but I'd put good money down on the age of 4. (That's when I started to associate 'Big ears' from Noddy with him as they looked a little similar. Lol) For most of my adult life I've been struggling with this unprocessed trauma and consequently borderline personality disorder and CPTSD. I have only really begun to truly heal and move on in the last couple of years or so, after years a rigorous self - analysis, research into my conditions and feeling as though I've been living in a horror movie of fresh and all the more painful flashbacks, recollections and realisations. (I don't think in such dramatic terms anymore. Lol, but it really did feel that horrifying for a large amount of time.)Although I've been through my fair share of abuse, I do feel very blessed as, despite it all, I have been raised by loving and caring parents that have made life at lot more pleasant and easy for me than it could have been. I know a lot of people that have been exposed to that level of abuse in early life often have no mentally/emotionally healthy or reliable caregivers, which was, very fortunately, not the case for me. Thanks for giving me the chance to share my story, I guess the only other thing I'd like all of you survivors to know is that, that is just what you are, SURVIVORS, not victims (though I know it can feel that way a lot of the time.)

I was crossing an organization on campus and one of the rules was not to mingle with the opposite sex. Towards the end of our time on line, they through a party for us. There was a lot of alcohol. I remember my then best friend and I being way too drunk to make it home and decided to stay because we were cool with the guy that hosted the party. He told us that we could stay in his room. I remember not being able to walk well. I remember that she wasn't as drunk as I was but we drank the same things. I remember falling asleep and him crawling in on the other side of me. I remember screaming out on pain then it being gone. Waking up to no underwear and confused. Blood still there . I couldn't remember it much. My best friend told me that he asked her to scoot over and made room next to me. That we had sex right next to her. I wouldn't have. I was asleep. I was fully dressed when I fell asleep and I was a virgin. I asked him what happened the next morning and he didn't respond. I was blamed by his friends who said that he would never do something like that. I was left out in the dark about other details and it took quite a while for her to tell me what happened that night. I was told that I was overreacting. My older brother told me that if I wasn't there in the first place it wouldn't have happened. I have not addressed the situation further and withdrew from the school. I see how it has caused damage to my current relationship. Honestly I wish it would go away.

136598840398995_139177686807777, Hello everyone. I have had a lifetime of incidents. As young as as memory starts to record traumas. I'm adopted so some offenders were adopted related.. But most were dating or relationships related most recent was my ex that dosed me on meth for about almost a year. At his parents house in his dirty room on a dissolving matress he had me so ruined dosing me all weekend But I said No! And squirmed and pushed back but he was stronger flipped me and raped me. He finished and turned into the angriest side I ever saw I asked to go home he refused to take me it was late. He did take me to a local hotel but his smoking got me flagged. I went back to his parents house but was panicking I walked streets I didn't know alone dosed up on meth completely setup for the pd to pick up. He stole my caid and charger so I couldn't get home. But I carried xtra batteries called my co parent and travelled to pick me up standing alone on my ex's streer corner.. He went silent day after and got involved with a cousin of his he connected with online maybe here or the other 1000s of apps he is on.. He sent me pictures of them the whole family accepted this inter family dating. He texted me about sexual issues he was having with her I kept blocking him but he hacked my network years ago and only device. He also sent me a nude image from his car at work on break. Why would I want to see the instrument of my destruction ever again and a smirk picture of his face.. Then he tells me his cousin is how I was when we firsr met clean sober independent social. He turned me into an addict rapes me on occasions. And no regrets just texts he hopes she can get him sober like I tried for a year.. This is insanity. But proving relationship rape and dosing aftermath is hard. And I'm in fear he knows everything. Thank you for reading.,Daryna Dixon,,status,,2017-10-19 17:36:12,5,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,0

136598840398995_139163240142555,"I've debated posting this since joining but I feel like the time is right. It's not something I go into great detail about or really consciously think about day to day but..The first time I remember being harassed was when I was 9 years old. A 13 year old catcalled me infront of his friends and touched my boob. I was on my own. I told the school and they made him apologise to me but that was it, no further repercussions. When I was 12/13 me and some friends used to play truth or dare. We were young and experimenting. There were some parts I was uncomfortable with but I went along with it. There were times I went on my own.. I really liked him but he didn't like me. But it was ok to tie me up in the woods. When I was 15 I went to a guys house. A friend of mine had already been in an abusive relationship with him but I was stupid and I didn't listen. I didn't even pay any mind that my first time was rape, I decided to be in a relationship with him. I convinced myself it was what I wanted to the point where a guy I really loved tried to get me out of it but I was trying so hard to stick by my dumb decisions I said no. That decision has haunted me. Eventually we broke up and I told my friends what had been going on. They said ok, one even rolled their eyes. They didn't believe me.When I was 17 I lost my dad. An older guy I knew who'd always been nice to me told me he'd lost his dad too and invited me over for company. I was living in my dad's empty house on my own and I was glad to talk to someone who I thought would understand. He was friends with my boyfriend at the time so I trusted him. He assaulted me. I didn't tell my boyfriend but I told some friends. He'd done it someone else I knew. They'd gone to the police and received little help. I decided to keep quiet.I had counselling around this time and it was suggested that because I can't remember a lot of my childhood maybe I was abused.. I didn't and still don't really want to get to the bottom of that to be honest. I'd rather just put that to the very back of my mind because I can't remember and if it's true I'd rather not.There's been other incidents since and in-between but these are the most poignant in my mind. There's been many ways these things have affected my life but I'm getting better and trying to work harder to confront issues head on moving forward.",Chrissy Confectionary Harrald,,status,,2017-10-19 17:00:16,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0

At the age of 10years old Iwas sexually molested by a boy that went to the same school as I and he was about 4 or 5 years older than I was at the time. That continued for about 4 months til I got the courage to tell someone to keep him away. I didn't tell them why though. Then a few years later when I was 14 years old I was sexually assaulted​ by my then boyfriend in the gym at the high school I was going to at the time. About a year later I was sexually assaulted and raped by someone I thought was my friend. I went to his house next door one day with my brother and my brother went home for a little bit and I thought I'd stay and hangout when he forced himself on me. Not many people know any of these things. And it makes it hard for me to trust men. And these things have gotten in the way of some of my relationships in the past.

The event will also educate pastors and church leaders on the topic of abuse and introduce them to safe practices and resources for their faith community. The Courage Conference offers a unique opportunity to hear from advocates and trained professionals through inspiring keynotes talks, Q&A sessions and workshops in addition to connecting attendees with local and national resources, so you don't have to do this alone.If you'd like to find support and a healing community, I'd like to personally invite you to join us.Scholarship application: www.ashleyeaster.com/scholarship",Ashley Schnarr Easter,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210415669455884&set=gm.138141943578018&type=3,2017-10-17 17:08:13,22,2,1,18,4,0,0,0,0,0

Then, people never let me to do my stuff by my own for me to express myself. Every timr whn I made mstake they were beat me and called me stupid, bu i stayed quiet never talked. I nevr leaned how to said ""no"". I kept every thing for myself. They always told me i won't be nothing. When i was 6 and 7 years old, i tried to sing in my church. I couldn't know how to sing so every one where laughing at me and called me stupid. My voice was soft, i was really slow in evrythng. They always told me any men will not lovd me and i will not never have a good job and house.They played bad games with me and hurt my feeling. I still stayed silent no talked. I began to have a huge depression and taumatized when i was13 years old, but i still nevr talked. I was tryied to kill myself every time, but those fake medication never worked. I always felt someone invsible followed me, becase of that my body and my mind stayed stucked means it was not flexible.

Age 14 molested by a male family member who was 18 during summer vacation, and then groped daily under my shirt in 8th grade English class by the boy behind me.Age 16 (this originally not in post as I typed it this all in Note and copied and pasted...missed this part in case anyone is wondering) Raped by my boyfriend's (at the time) brother-in-law. We had moved to a new town 9 months before. I was at the BIL's house with a friend and her boyfriend who was an acquaintance with BIL at the time. Rapist's wife found out and accused me of trying to steal her husband. And had my ""friend"" set me up and take me to BIL's house where BIL, his sister, wife, my ""friend"" and her boyfriend and my ""boyfriend"" all (except ""friend"") either watched or took part in beating me. They finally let me go and I walked to a repair shop to use the phone. I called for a ride to my house and hid in my room from my parents until the next day. Once Mom found out what happened she took me to the ER for X-rays of my face, and then to PD. The PD made a report, but didn't believe he actually raped me. None of the received any punishment at all. We moved back to our old town and I never saw any of them again. 32 years later and I still wonder where they are.Age 22 attempted rape by a friend of a friend who was 20 years older than me. He took me to his van at a party when I asked where the bathroom was. I got away by finally pretending I needed to vomit (I had been drinking) and he opened the van door. I ran in to the party and had someone take me home. These are just the times I was actually touched. I've had teachers, bosses, a landlord, and others my comments or ""offers"" such as free rent or promotions.Until now I have never mentioned the sitter's daughter, or classmate incidences. Thru  I have discovered my younger sister is also a member of this club nobody wants to be a member of. Now I wonder is it because I waited so long to say anything about the family member?

But still this issue is of great importance to me.I am quite upset, disappointed and sad every time I read or hear about this disrespect for people and this horrible attack against peoples dignity, destroying their self esteem and giving them lots of health problems like anxiety, depression and in worst case post-traumatic stress disorder.I have been working as a therapist for many years and I have met several women telling about their bad experiences with sexual abuse and every time I feel humble that they open the door for me to this often very difficult subject to talk about and even filled with shame even that we know that they never have guilt or responsibility for what happened. And every time I hear these nice, honest, caring women being a far to strong and hard judge against themselves inside I am thinking: This is so unfair and I am always trying to make them be more kind to their soul and heart cause thats the medicine they need and deserve....so I am full of respect for you all, men and women who have such horrible story and even have been sharing it at this site.Actually I have recently made a new song about sexual abuse called «Let there be light» where I am trying to describe the nerve of the feelings and thoughts going through a victim's mind from hopelessness and despair to step by step regaining hope and faith for the future also offcourse depending on support and understanding from people around them.I want to make a musicvideo next year with this song combined with dance and some acting illustrating my song.I will later on publish my lyrics on this site.To all of you: I wish you a good day filled with hope, light and strenght ❤",Børge Ravndal,,status,,2017-10-18 00:12:36,16,3,0,12,4,0,0,0,0,0

136598840398995_138666596858886," - Myself, along with my 3 sisters, were sexually molested by my parents, mostly my dad, from the 6th grade until I was 18 years old and was able to run away from home and hide! He was also very controlling, manipulative and emotionally abusive and started taping all of our phone conversations, but we didn't know that for quite a while, he just told us he was paying people to watch us everywhere we were which made me into a very paranoid person with very bad trust issues! My twin sister and I figured it out one day when they were gone and from that point forward we never said anything on the phone that we didn't want our parents to know anything about. They were very strict on us and didn't allow us to have friends over or to go anywhere. I never did anything without their permission anyways, as I wasn't one of the typical rebellious teenagers, but my dad wouldn't allow me to have any boyfriends either unless I allowed him to do things to me, so I never had any. My mom knew he was doing things to us, but she wouldn't help us! He did mostly everything to me while she took all of my other sisters to the grocery store. He said I was the prettiest. How sick is that?!?!As soon as I met my first husband, David Strachan, in the Summer of 1984 before my Senior year in High School at a Summer dance, he was a very nice guy and there seemed to be something really special about him. He was a Bouncer and went to a different High School, so we didn't get to see each other much, but we became really close quickly and fell in love and I confided in him what was going on with me and in our house and he and his parents did everything they could to help me. And no matter how much my parents tried to keep us apart, the stronger our relationship became. As soon as the timing was right, his parents let me move in with them and I had him arrested in 1985, but he got out of jail and was never fully prosecuted. (Too long of a story to get into, but he's dead now and I believe GOD will take care of him in HIS own way.)I've always open about what I went through and spoken about it and I know I've helped a lot of people because I do continue to talk about it. I suffer from PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc., and sometimes still have nightmares. But, I'm a survivor and I want others to know it's never too late to ask for help!Always be sure to surround yourself with love and people you can trust and be sure that those closest to you know what happened to you because they're the one(s) you're going to need when you have days where you're going to need to talk about it, and they need to be able to understand where you're coming from. I've always believed honesty works best and more times than not, I've gotten a lot more support now than I did way back then.I'm here for anyone who ever wants to talk or wants me to listen. I'm in the process of writing my memoir and I don't know when it'll be published, but I just hope it'll help at least one person out.❤#ImASurvivor#ParentsShouldntMolestTheirKids#StopSexualAbuse",Kathy Couture Strachan Kamins,Photos from Kathy Couture Strachan Kamins's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213096229856123&set=gm.138666596858886&type=3,2017-10-18 15:55:43,23,4,1,10,9,0,0,4,0,0

It started out very simple and regular relationship, he treated me right. Thanks that really changed till about a month into it. It all started one day at the lake he was forcing himself onto me then my sister. If we didn’t do what he wanted he would force us underwater or pull her hair or grab ahold of us. He tried to get me to do with him, he didn’t have protection and I wasn’t ready so try not to so I came up the excuse of I didn’t want to get pregnant. He tried to convince me by saying he was sterile, I didn’t trust him on it and I said no and he forcibly touched me then. He was continually abusive towards me he would pull me to the ground every chance he got, he would pull my hair grab hold of me, and you try to force me on his other friend. I was forced to kiss his other friend in front of him and let him touch me for C’s pleasure. Eventually my dad came out side one time when he was touching me and saw, when he saw he kicked C out and didn’t let him to come back. He eventually came back but I ended up ending things finally. Only the first timeThe second time was with S. this was again summer 2013.  We have been dating about three weeks at this point and I went over to his aunts house to meet some of his  family. Well eventually he wanted to go swimming and I don’t have a bathing suit so borrowed his cousins. When we got in the pool he was kissing me which was normal and eventually he cornered me and started pulling the shorts I was wearing and i was trying to stop him but he kept saying “ if you like me you’d let me do this” eventually I gave in cause  He was stronger and he got the shorts off and kissing me pulling my bottoms to the side and pulled it out. No matter what I tried I couldn’t get free and he successfully got it in. S got arrested later that week for running away from home (he was a minor too) and I ended things through his grandma who he had call me when I wouldn’t answer his calls from the jail. And that was that. The final time was D. This was summer 2016. He was my sisters ex bf and my brothers best friend so he stayed the nights a lot with my brother and this was any other night. Except this night I decided to be nicer to him as it seemed I couldn’t get rid of him after he mentally abused my sister. And I didn’t wanna be mad in my own place. Well that night I went to bed with my dog in bed with me like normal and my door opened for her to get in and out, just like every other night. Well some point in the night he crawled into bed with me while I was asleep and started touching me over my clothes. He touched my boobs, and my other area heavily. Just as he was slipping his hand inside my clothes I woke up and stopped him and kicked him out. I shut my door and locked it and triple checked the lock. After I had a panic attack and I couldn’t go back to sleep. I never opened up about the first two until it was 2 almost 3 years after. But with him I told people the next day. I told my mom, some church people I trusted and my brother. My mom decided we shouldn’t press charges as he was heavily on drugs and severely depressed and she talked to him about it and how it was wrong. I was 13,13, and 16 when these things happened to me. I wasn’t dressed any differently than anyone else around me. And one of the times I was even not conscious to give consent. It’s my story and i am ready to tell it. I am now 18 and I’m loving life atm. One of my goals in life it to make it to 2020 and 2023 to say my body has never been touched by them. That I’m me and nothing will change that. I will over come this ",Trish Willis,,status,,2017-10-18 22:11:00,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

136598840398995_138745273517685,"Usually the victim is afraid to confront for getting hurt forgetting that hurt is already inflicted by being abused. If you don’t confront you will continue to getting hurt. But if you confront then there is possibility that further hurt is stopped for you. It may even stop him/her from hurting other innocent people.First time a far away older cousin tried to touch me I didn’t know how to respond except I knew what is happening is wrong. So I ran and kept avoiding him. Eventually threatened to expose him. Which stopped him from bothering me but he switched his target to another girl. Second time my father’s friend tried kissing me forcefully during a family event taking advantage of darkness I screamed and told everyone what he did. He tried refusing but my father didn’t trust him. He was immediately given the consequences. This made me strong. Thereafter I could read the signs of abuser and not just kept myself away but spoke with people around him, making it very uncomfortable for him to continue. Fortunately my parents were very strong people and trusted me and protected us. We need to educate parents on how to protect children. But worst is when parents themselves abuse children.

That I'm oversensitive, that this was simply bad luck on my part (several dozen times, seriously???!!!). Stop convincing me it's just a statistical error. A coincidence. Something one should not really be disturbed by.Or would you rather tell me it's my fault? I inherited a huge old armchair from my grandmother - all else burned in the war - oh, but yes, there is also this very feminine shape. Curves. Guitar-like. Hips. Buttocks. Large, full, definitely noticeable breasts...I didn't want to see the first erection of my life on a disgusting guy who cornered me - a ten-year old back then - in a stairwell.I didn't want the series of images, men jerking off, in the Łazienki park, in Pole Mokotowskie, on an almost empty tram.I didn't take the bus to school to be rubbed against by random guys.I didn't want a drunk guest trying to French kiss me din a family function.Dear primary school classmates, you joking about my growing breasts and humiliating me in public was not funny at all.Dear culture center instructor, your comment on my assets was actually abuse, too.As a thirteen-year-old I went to a cinema with another girl - to see a movie, not to try to escape a man from the next seat trying to grab me, hiding under a coat. That was when I would have loved to have had a razor on me...Road workers and drunkards, you whistling and catcalling me is abuse, too. ""I'd love to fuck you, whore"" is kind of tough on a high-schooler's psyche. So is ""nice boobs, bitch"".Passer-by back in June 2017, I did not slap your face for exclaiming ""I'd grab your tits"" looking at me wearing a modest t-shirt - but just because my hands were full of groceries I bought to cook a dinner for my kids.Dirty loser from a construction site nearby, you whistling and singing about my legs does not make me extatic just because I am forty now and still earned a compliment. Actually, I want to throw up listening to you. Probably because I'm oversensitive.I let you all go because there was a time when I couldn't defend myself. But you, fucker, you who touched my ten-year-old's hair with admiration as she rode on a bus, paralyzed with shame and fear - remember it was just that once that all I did was stomp you into the ground verbally. Should any of you touch any of my girls again, be it with a dirty gesture or a vile word - I will tear you balls off and push them into your throat through the nose. I don't care what the sentence might be - they have libraries in prisons, after all. And it might even turn out that after all the years of enduring this I'd be more than able to plead insanity.

No one is denying what you are saying but the focus of this campaign is women for a very good reason. Rape laws were created to protect men's property and that alone. therefore the history of rape is that it was legal for men to rape either their wives or unmarried women for centuries and that is the culture that has been handed down. There has never been a similar law allowing women to sexually assault. Raping women has been backed up by political power for centuries. This campaign was actually started to fight back about Harvey Weinstein abusing women in Hollywood. It is unfair to make this campaign about men as if women areent allowed to speak out about issues that affect us without putting everyone else first all the time. Would you turn up at a breast cancer event and tell people they are excluding people who have other types of cancer? This is the equivalent of that.

136598840398995_138486766876869,"...YOU must have known not to leave me alone with your father. YOU must have known that I would be different from that day forward. YOU must have known I would blame myself. It was the first time I was ever alone with your father. It only took one day of trust and my life was changed forever. You were always with him; you lived in his home. Did you stay awake when your mother went to sleep? Were you afraid to close your eyes? After that dark day I was afraid to close my eyes, needing light.That day, when I was five or so, I trusted you and my brother.  When you asked my parents if I could go to Yosemite, I was excited because I had never been allowed to be away from home without my mother. It was my brother, his wife, my two nephews, myself and her father. We were going camping and I was excited, as excited as I could be going to Yosemite National Park. My parents always worked. They could not give me the luxury of a camping trip. Coming from the deserts of Arizona, the trees and green beauty of Yosemite,  California smelled of life.You knew and I hate you or you did not know and I wonder how many girls he hurt.  We found a camp site. Honestly, the details of eating or playing are a blur. I remember my brother and you slept in the blazer. Someone,  probably my brother, put up a tent. I remember like it was yesterday that it was my two younger nephews, me and your father. We lay in that order in that tent.  Why did you put me in there, the only girl, in that tent? Would you have trusted your father with your daughter, if you had one?That night everything changed. Thank you for not protecting me. Thank you for throwing me in the lion's den. I remember the grizzly bear outside the tent. I saw his shadow looking for food. Would it have been better if he had found me? At least I would have been his feast and not your father's toy. It goes round and round my head. You had sisters. They had friends. He must have done it before, your father. He must have done it to you, your father. Why did you not protect me? One night, a few hours with no sleep that seemed like eternity.I knew he was an old man, your father. I was asleep next to him, your father.  I cry and cry these days because I can still remember his filthy hands touching me. He touched me where my mommy said no one should touch me, over and over. I was awake but did not know what to do. I did not look at his shadowy face. I was silent. I turned around thinking he would stop and he did not stop. Tears roll down my cheeks because there and then I knew he was doing something very wrong. I knew he was sick and he touched me with his diseased hands.  How could you let him? Did you know!?!?The sun came out and I was embarrassed.  I was a victim and I thought the police were going to come and arrest me. I did not say anything. I was quiet. I did not look at his monstrous face hiding behind that old man. I thought I did something that made him be bad. It was my fault, I thought. I made them take me home as I was sick. My brother was angry because his trip was cut short. If I had told him, would he have called the police? For over 30 years I still feel like it is my fault. I finally told my brother a few years back and he told me to move on. Thank you brother. I would if I could.He is buried now. Many years now. I smiled when I heard he died. I thought about our maker and how he would have to face his sentence. None such as him can be forgiven. I want to forget what your father did to me. I want to forgive you for knowingly trapping me in his arms. I cry now for my innocence lost so long ago.",Susana R Zaragoza,,status,,2017-10-18 08:39:19,24,4,0,5,4,0,0,14,1,0

Da traf ich einen Jungen aus meiner Klasse, den ich kannte. Ich hatte ihm Russisch Nachhilfe gegeben. Er war mein Sitznachbar in der Schule. An dem Abend, als ich betrunken war, traf ich ihn auf der Strasse. Er bot mir an, einen Spaziergang zu machen. Wir gingen zum Mont Klamott in Berlin. Ich hatte ein diffuses ungutes Gefühl, auf das ich nicht gehört habe. Dann bedrohte er mich mit einem Stein, wenn ich nicht einwillige mit ihm Sex zu haben. So nahm er sich was er wollte. Lange verdrängte Geschichte, nun wieder mehr präsent. Ich möchte aber gar nichts weiter dazu sagen. Trotzdem regt mich das Schreiben irgendwie auf. Ich habe vergeben (?), lasse los und folge meiner Freude und Begeisterung. Ich habe ein schönes Leben. Was bringt es, diese Geschichten hochzuholen? Was können andere davon lernen?

The project consists of 2 components one would be an audio recording of person's story and second would be me taking some pictures of the person (you don't have to show your face or reveal your identity if you are not comfortable with it) (the project is being shot in Montreal). Everyone is welcome to participate since I believe that it is important for everyone's story to be heard, not only to help fight sexual abuse, but also to support people that are currently struggling and feel alone in their struggle.On another note if you want to share your story but feel like doing it yourself is too much or you don't live in the area you can message it to me anonymously (in text or audio form) with the understating that it might be used in the project.

One is personal humiliation, however, does humiliation endure forever? Two is cost of time and effort, however, we all can learn to manage those effectively. Three is being publicly ostracized (called out, degraded), however, why waste energy worrying about what others think?

136598840398995_138567810202098,"Hey all!When I was 20 I went through something as well. I don't like to specify but I can tell you how I coped and maybe I can help some here to deal with their own stuff. The first years I surpressed what happened (it was a one time experience), also: I was convinced it was my fault, that I was the weak person at that moment and that I could have prevented what had happened, that I had been just stupid. Only after talking about it three years later with some girlfriends, they made clear to me that what happened was clearly wrong and that it was in no way my fault. That not being able to stop this person was not my fault. I can assure you, this was a hard thing to accept because I'm a proud person. Another important thing: even tough I never received any excuse, I knew this person felt ashamed about what he had done. I could see it in his eyes if we sometimes crossed in a street. I knew that seeing me was a confrontation for him, one that reminded of what had happened. And he was for sure not proud of it. I don't doubt that feeling this has helped me to cope. I knew that if he could turn back time, he would have done otherwise. The fact I was in this experience didn't keep me from going out. But the experience left me with a filthy feeling, it distanced me from my own body. I was aware of it, but is was my way to cope and to be able to try to live my life like I wanted to, despite what happened. I never wanted to feel like a victim, it is the worst feeling there is so I wanted to feel: I and only I am in charge of my life. That tomorrow is a new day and that if I want to have joy in my life and grow, get further in life, then I was the one who was going to do it, no matter what happened 'yesterday'. I don't say it was easy, not at all. I have felt nauseous for so so many times, for being reminded of that experience years and years after it happened. And if I meet someone new, I always get mixed up feelings about sex, because it reminds me of this feeling of being disempowered in a situation and of that filthy feeling. But if I like that person enough, if I manage to trust him, I know I'm able to let go of the other feeling. And I want to let women know who went through a abusive situation or another kind of cross-border behavior that I believe that every one of you, can on their own rhythm and in their own unique way, find the way back to the feeling of good self-esteem, of dignity, of (self) empowerment. In the end you always have to row with the oars you have today, but that doesn't mean a brighter future is waiting for you tomorrow. But yes it can be very hard, and healing is a slow process so patience is really key. But it is so worth it. <3 <3 <3",Amarie T Pixie,,status,,2017-10-18 11:39:12,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0

Police came and took my sheets but i told them i had washed them and went to the obgyn and i had healed. Police still went after him. A week later he had Will come by to get his things he had left at my house told them i gave them to the police. Will attacked me dissconnected all the landlines and ramsacked the house and locked me in a room. He called najee and he came over and raped me again this time with a condom and beat my ass. Then They left i was shaking on the floor so sacared out of my mind. I straighten up the house and stayed silent until my mom relise i had bruises as i changed and things were missing in the house.

There were number of incidents for two years before this, but this was the one that really showed I was on my own in this world. I had never feared for my life before. I was in the 6th grade and made friends with a girl named Diane. She introduced me to her cousin Vicki. Vicki's family ran a motel in town near where I lived. I spent a few weeks hanging around with Vicki. Then One day she asked me if I would like to go on a over night fishing trip on the river with her and her dad. I thought it would be great, I didn't get to do a lot of these kinds of things. [sidebar] My mom was a single mom working her but off to support two kids and she had just entered a meaningful relationship, first one in 6 years. So she never brought any jerk offs home. She and the rest of the family just had a talent for De-Nile of any topic that was messy. On with the show. I have no memory of what happened thru that day. what is stuck in my head is going down the river to the canyon. When we got to a point he liked we dropped anchor, that what he called it. This was the place we were going to sleep for the night. He put out three sleeping bags with his in the middle. I woke up with his hand over my mouth and nose. With him whispering in my right right ear ""be quiet or I'l throw you over the side of the boat and hold you under"". All I see is the moon above the edge of the canyon. Not sure how things went from there. I know that Vicki started calling my house with crank calls, I ended up in trouble for not being a grateful child. This is the hearest thing in my life to talk about because I have blocked so much of it. The one thing I do know is that there is a picture of me with my 6th grade class, and if you have half a brain you can tell that something was going on. I listened to no one from that point on. All adults were just as stupid as children and didn't give a fuck about anyone but themselves.",Debra Asay,,status,,2017-10-18 09:21:25,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0

MEN will NOT be silenced by toxic masculinity and gender norms/expectations! Men can be raped by anyone at any age and deserve love and justice the same as women! From the day I was born until now I have experienced a lot of pain and suffering at the hands of people for various reasons or sometimes for no reason at all. Neglect, abuse, physical, mental, emotional, sexual, and more, by people who I thought loved me but over time showed they did not. Family, parents, friends, strangers have all contributed in my suffering. They made me believe it was normal and that I could forget it happening and pretend it never existed, BUT I COULD NEVER FORGET. And I NEVER will. I wasn't allowed to speak up, to feel, to cry or show any emotion. For years I hid it until I finally broke down to my guidance counselor at school. I told the detectives but they called me a liar. I never got justice for any of the many abusers and pedofiles I met. They may have gotten away with their evil crimes, but they will get what's coming to them. By speaking up and REFUSING to be silent, REFUSING to forget, we can bring them down. Every single one of them. #SpeakUp AND LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD!

136598840398995_138078726917673,"Yesterday, I shared apart of my story... Today, I'd like share to another part; a much deeper part.This one is called #MyChildrenToo an abused one's worst nightmare.#MyChildrenTooIt is the worst pain to feel... knowing that you too failed to protect your child as your own parents had done for you. While I was going through my homeless/prostitution phase, I opted to let my oldest stay with his father so that he wouldn't be subjected to bullcrap that I was going through. His father, too busy chasing after women; left my son in the care of his alcoholic mother and her abusive boyfriend (unbeknownst to me at the time). Once I was on my feet, and had secured an apartment for us; I took him back. I noticed IMMMEDIATELY something was wrong. My son would wake EVERY morning between 3am - 4am and scream/cry uncontrollably..no matter how much you tried to sooth him. He wouldn't allow my husband (at the time) to bathe him as he'd always done. He would scream out, ""No! Don't touch my peepee. Don't touch my weewee."" As a child of abuse, I freaking knew these signs all too well. But, I let others convince  me that I was being paranoid because of my own history and that nothing happened to my son. It came out two years later, after I found my son molesting his younger brother 😢😢😢 I sat him down and I asked him where did he learn this from? Had anyone done this to him? And, my son went into a state of shock, almost like a trance. Tears fell from his eyes, as he mouthed the word ouch repeatedly.. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My heart filled with so much hate. I finally got him to speak to me and he told me that the grandmother's boyfriend had sodomized my son and performed oral sex on him 😢😢😢I took him to the dr... they said it was there was nothing they could do because the physical damage wasn't visible.  A year later, another incident happen with my son's and I grew tired... I called ACS (children protective services) for help... they told me his removal would be temporary. They lied! I battled a whole year to get my son back. The judge called me unfit and unstable, and threatened to remove my other children because of my own abuse. It was also revealed during the case that the boyfriend was a registered  level 3 sex offender 😢😢😢 and, the grandmother knew all along. During the time that my oldest son was away, I discovered my second son (7) directing my  daughter (3) and son (4) to perform oral sex one another. And just like that, all of my children had been tainted. The last two years have been the hardest... intense therapy for all the children, separate sleeping quarters, video monitors in their rooms etc..I am happy to say there hasn't been anymore instances thus far but it is something that I will always watch for and fear.Thank you for allowing me to tell my stories... these last two days have been more therapeutic for me than all my years in therapy.",Marie A Norfleet,,status,,2017-10-17 14:06:47,24,5,0,6,6,0,0,12,0,0

136598840398995_138355753556637,"When reporting what happened did anyone refuse “the kit”? If so, did your report get mishandled and disregarded?I had been struggling with a few different things during the time my assault happened. I was 17, was reported to the police as possibly missing by my mom, I got home very late. When asked where I was I just said I fell asleep in my car because of stress. The next day I go to work and try to hold on. I was messing up at work and couldn’t contain myself anymore. I asked to go on break and then called my at the time boyfriend and confessed what happened. He blamed me for what happened, said I should have been more careful. By the time I’m done with my phone call my break is up. That was the first time I had ever asked to leave work. My mom and I are very close, and I felt I needed her more than ever and to keep this from her was guilting me. I also did not want her to think I was carrying on the family assault. It’s awful. I get home and my mom is in my room, she has her phone on record mode and she’s going through my room. I tell her I know it’s on record, I’m going to say I don’t care. I say we need to talk.. and we walk to her room and I lay on her bed and I said everything... I laid it all out. At the end she asks that I report it. I refuse and she said she would feel better if I did. So, I give it another day. I finally agree and we drive at night to the police station. My mom hands them her phone and says here is her confession. I did not know she got my whole confession on tape. She didn’t mean to, but she realized she did. Once they heard it and heard my statement: they did not believe me because the person was well known and his position in the state, they did not believe. So they sent me to the hospital to get a kit done. They were about to do it, and I went in alone, told my mom I wanted to do it alone. And that’s when I said, no. I know what I went through I know what happened. It was not rape, so why do the kit? Why put me through more agony? They have my clothes, my pants and underwear from that night. I left a tissue of evidence and told the cops where to go, and they got it, so I refused. Meanwhile I end up going to a treatment center in IL and my mom is battling the state because they did not believe me. My mom told me I was going to have a case against him, but little did I know she lied and what really happened is they dropped it entirely. I said no the first time to all of this, I should not need a kit to say no to and be denied entirely because I said no. THE GUY ADMITTED EVERYTHING. And said it was consensual. I was 17, he was 24-30. I worked with him and on thanksgiving after a fight with my parents, I sought help from someone who was a state rep, and who stood for protecting child rights. The state didn’t believe what happened to me because of what he claimed he stood for. He took advantage of someone who needed help.",Emily Pike,,status,,2017-10-18 03:44:56,8,1,0,5,0,0,0,3,0,0

About a month ago a photo came up of me I was around 5 from a family member & he & I were tagged in it! I wrote to my cousin requesting the photo be taken down. She asked why & I told her! I had my own family attacking me for bringing up what happened when I was a child! Two of his own children(my cousins that I have never met) contacted me via FB & said that they support me 100%❤️ They have not spoken or seen him for years for the safety of their children. He contacted me via FB & says he is sorry ""if"" he had hurt me but he can't ""recall"" it! He then asked that if we talk through FB could it just be between us!  Almost the secretcy  he wanted when I was little. He wanted me to call him or he call so that we could talk. I have left it for now as I am not ready.

136598840398995_138354026890143,"I would like to share my story in hopes of helping someone out. When I was 18 I was set up by a friend who asked me out one night. He told me he would take me back home after we go out to eat. As we ordered our drinks, and food I excused myself to the restroom, when I returned I took a couple sips from my drink, and began talking to my friend. I started to feel funny, and I asked him if he could take me home, and he said no I will not be taking you home, but my friend will. I don't really remember much after that until I came to. I was laying in someone's bed, and I remember my head hurting so bad. I over heard someone talking about money, and how much they could make. They brought some younger girl in to show me how I should give a blow job, as she did it to one of the guys that was in the room. They then told me I had to dress a certain way, as I was so out of my mind from the drugs they made me take.. I really don't remember much, but as I laid on the floor of a trailer in the back of a car lot in a very bad area in Orlando, I remember waking up to different men having sex with me. I prayed so hard. My mom would get on my nerves trying to always be in my business at that time, but I thank God for that now because they would have used me until there was nothing left. My mother tracked down the people who she thought had a clue, and got the police involved, but the police told her if we want to report human trafficking that the organization is to big, and that if we didn't know all the names then we would have to go into hiding, or just walk away, and not say anything. So at this time at the place I was being held, the phone rang, and the man with the plan answered it, and told me it was for me. I didn't know what to think so I picked it up, and on the other end I could hear my mom's voice saying that she had something important to say, but she was to shook up to say it, so next I hear my dad, he sounded so sad, and he told me that the cops will be there shortly, and when they get there that I was not to say anything, just walk out, and that they would be there shortly. Well that's not how it worked, when the police arrived they asked me my name, and I don't remember anything as I was without water or food for days, and they just kept me drugged. I tried to walk out the door but I was blinded by the many police vehicles that had there flashing lights on.. I tried to grab onto something, and the first thing I grabbed was a police officer as I felt like I was about to fall, and she helped by slamming me to the ground, and her back up squad beat me in the back with night sticks. I was arrested for resisting arrest with violence. My first charge, and I was offered 5 yrs paper, but I ended up doing 3 out, and 1 in. I have a lot of information that can help anyone if you would like to ask me any questions I will do my best to answer.

136598840398995_138007933591419,"A small part of me feels like it’s wrong to post , because for me I’ve never been raped or attacked physically by a stranger, or molested since I was young by a loved one. I’ve not had it as bad as other women and I know that. But I also know that any amount of sexual harassment or assault is not okay. Being flirted with while I’m working isn’t okay, especially after I’ve mentioned I have a long time boyfriend of over 8 years. Being cat called while I walk down the street isn’t okay. Having men constantly tell me that I have a pretty smile and should smile for them more isn’t okay. Being harassed and called a “fat b*tch” when I reject their invite to go out sometime isn’t okay. Being groped in high school by one of my “best friends” isn’t okay- even though we all laughed about it and shrugged it off as “well that’s something that he does to his female friends, it’s funny.” Having my bra undone in school by the same friend, who then acts as if he scored a touch down by doing so, isn’t okay. This same friend is still a friend today, and every time I see him he grabs or slaps my butt and laughs about it, cause I’m such a cool chick who lets him do stuff like that. These stories are just the tip of the iceberg. And up until recently I quietly accepted them, even tho every time someone touched me or called after me made my chest heavy and stomach drop; even tho it killed my sex life with my boyfriend because even when I’m in the mood I have a hard time feeling wanted or comfortable, so we never do anything. I just feel used and I hate that, especially when I tell myself that it isn’t THAT big of deal, or it shouldn’t be. My friend never raped me, right? Nobody ever raped me, it was all just playful banter and words, right? So I should just get over it, right? No, I shouldn’t. I should be angry and upset that these people think they have control over my body in these ways. In words or physical touch. I should be furious that I’ve allowed men to control how I feel about myself and my relationship up until now. I have a wonderful and patient boyfriend who I’ve known for 10 years and dated for over 8, and for the past 5 or 6 I’ve let how other men look at me and define me control how I acted towards him. But not anymore. Because even though I may not have gone through something as traumatic as some women, I’ve still gone through things that were traumatic to ME. And I won’t let those things or those men define me anymore. And I know there’s many other women out there with similar stories. As women we need to stand together, link arms, and be strong for one another. Because we’re all we have. ",Sarah Elizabeth LeBlanc,,status,,2017-10-17 11:02:35,31,5,0,18,10,0,0,3,0,0

I did a few weeks ago hadn't seen my grandad since I disclosed 5 years ago I got no justice off the dpp but I got some from child protection services I kept thinking he was going to die and I never get to confront him for about a year I kept discussing it with my doctor counselors family no one really thought it was a good idea and there wasn't alot of survivors online saying yeah they did went swimmingly I'd brake down even thinking about doing it but the fear of walking down his road got to much for me so I said fuck it went to his house I brought my bro for safety he didn't say anything. My grandad answered the door it took him a moment to recognize me. I said calm we need to talk and he said you better come in.. I was very angry but was trying my best to stay calm I decided before I went in that I didn't want to hurt him. I said what have you got to say for yourself? And he said what about your lies.. I proceeded to tell me of all the times he abused me, my auntie, my cousin. And he said you made me do it. What? He said he was sleeping and I woke him up unbuckling his belt keep in mind I was 6 he said I told him if he didn't show me his Willy I'd tell me mammy he touched me? No this made my blood boil cause this is what he tells people but I had worked on this with my counselor and I said OK even if what your saying was true which it's not bit let's say it was a child blackmails you to see your penis and you think that's ok. And he said no it's not OK but you made. I start screaming other incidents that happen like it was a weekly occurance from age 6-12 I got very close to my grandad and I really wanted to hit him bit my bro touch my shoulder and I stood back and took a breath. My grandad says you were a very cute child. And I say what promiscuous? And he says no you always had to have 2 shots 2 gos we I'd be playing games with all the kids and you always had to have to 2 shots. In that moment I knew there is no point talking to this man he's not crazy or senial he's a fucking pervert and a pedophile he can't admit what he done and it's killing him that I tell every person I know that lives on his street he will never be able to hurt another child again... I walked out of that house with my head held high screaming you dirty pedophile at the top of my voice he can feel the shame now..!!!For few days after I was in my head thinking alot I was very up and down but I can't tell you the release I got from it like I go past his house nearly everyday and now I've no fucking fear of running into him.  #survivor #warrior #survivorofchildabuse #survivorofabuse #survivor #warrior #breakthesilence #youarenotalone #befree  #noshame #freedom #bebrave #nomoresecrets #lightattheendofthetunnel #therapy #recovery #survivorofchildabuse #adultsurvivorofchildhoodsexualabuse #ptsd #depression  #addiction #eatingdisorder #love #happy",Marlene O'Brien,,status,,2017-10-17 17:52:01,10,1,0,6,3,0,0,1,0,0

136598840398995_137201467005399,"well never been raped myself. I was lucky so far.For myself: 1. with 15, some old man sitting beside me, stroking my knee in the train - I was paralyzed with irritation and disgust2. with 16 someone reaching in between my legs at the marine zoo - in the darkness, never saw his face.3. with 16.Summer job. Male worker in his thirties showed me how to operate the computer - standing behind me, arms to my left and to my right worked the keyboard - quite full body contact. I didn't care that much, didn't realize anything very wrong, just slightly uncomfortable. But female collegues in the same office stopped him and told him not to do it that way again.4. with 18. Teacher of a school abroad, that I attended to learn a foreign language, came to my school, and was invited by my parents for dinner - started touching and stroking my knee during dinner under the table. I was emberassed and just ignored it. My boyfriend at the table as well realized it, and gave him a hard stare - so he stopped. My parents didn't notice, but we told them afterwards. BTW when I was abroad (with 16) he never tried to touch me. This was in some way the worst experience - as it was in my home, my sfe place, with mummy and daddy and boyfriend aside - and this didn't prevent the 5. mid twenties: very late evening at university: I thought I was alone, an older collegue entered, and asked me, why I always wear such oversized T-shirts "" as You have such a nice shape body"". I told him, he should better stop, this may be mistaken as sexual harrassment . He apologized a thousand times. He was embarassed. Now I think, it was really simply a thoughtless compliment at absolutely wrong place & wrongt time. But he scared me to death by this. We were all alone in a huge building. BTW: And guess WHY I was wearing oversized T-shirts - guess why, who knows? YES! Because I knew, I had a nice shape body - but still: the wide T-Shirts to mask this fact obviously didn't help! No points to this guy ;)6.&7. mid twenties.  twice waking up in the train from a short nap on my way home in the early afternoon, to find a man sitting opposite, masturbating- theses were two different men. But the reaction was similar: jumped up and fled out of the train when I opened my eyes.8. mid thirty: On my way home (6 p.m.), man hiding beside the pavement in the shadow, masturbating, following me. I ran to a supermarket and we called the police. Again scared to death, crying. At least I did react and try to catch him with the police.I think: that's it. Peanuts compared to rape and abuse. But quite some peanuts. And those who had really bad experiences they still have to fight with, won't mention such ""trivialities"". Most girls/women won't. But not mentioning them means, they are invisible to those, who don't experience ist. How can the good men, that are the absolut majority - at least in my surrounding - how can they understand the range of this problem, if no-one tells them? I get so angry, when they say 'seperate toilets for men and woman are obsolete"", that hey are ""portraied as monsters"" being under ""general suspicion"".I'm fine with unisex toilets. With the collegues I know and trust. During day. When everything is crowded. But at night - when there are hardly any people around - well then I prefer not to meet a man at the toilet. That may scare me to death...sorry to all the good boys. You definitely pay for the bad ones. But please, please spare me your reproval. Please be at my side, to keep me safe. To give me shelter from the bad ones.Then there are continuously so many occasions, when I'm startled as I watch some man approaching a young, helpless girl in a typical manner - or a group of grown boys/young men. Then I try to help. Which is often difficult, as no-one wants to admit that anything is wrong. Because the 'touch' of knee by knee between elder man and girl (sitting so close in the waiting room) is really ""accidental"" - but I see him pressing his knee aside and her being paralyzed, not able to move - and I will go there and ask her, if she could get up to sit by my side, because I forgot my glasses and need someone to read to me some- whatever. And she will get up - relieved- thankful - and I will ask her (in safe distance) if she didn't feel uncomfortable with this body-contact. And as she agrees, I explain to her that she can be 'unpolite' and get up and change seat whenever she feels to. She need not endure, if she feels uncomfortable...  Such scenes happen too often. We have to help the young ones. You get older. You get more self confident. Men could help too, but they simply often underestimate the situation. It often starts so ... descrete. And indeed: regarding the law, this is 'nothing'.So I rank myself among the lucky ones. But I hope that men understand, what's going on. And I hope that they stop to protect the poor buddies that are wrongfully under general suspicion, but start to open their eyes. And understand that the protection of women is not 'against them' and their friends, and that accusation against individual men who did wrong is not ment against 'menfolk', but just against the bad ones. I don't know, how many of my friends have been raped. Probabely some.So why do men think that none of their friends has anything to do with harassment? Do you really think they would tell????... sorry for the longtext.",Elisabeth Leiss,,status,,2017-10-16 16:31:52,7,4,0,2,3,0,0,2,0,0

136598840398995_137358623656350,"I was four years old, the first time I walked in on my parents being intimate. Confused, I later asked my ""father"" what he and my mom were doing. He explained that they were having sex. I asked, what's sex? He told me. Then, he asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. 😔😔😔That's where it all began, an innocent child with a complicated question. He started molesting me, two years later. Every night, after everyone went to sleep... my body would cringe every time I would hear the floorboard by my bedroom door creak. My skin would crawl as I felt him hoover over my bed, as he'd prepared himself with Vaseline and popped a porno in my VCR. Soon, an uncle that was living with us at the time decided to join in. It was like they rotated nights, one nightmare after another.This went on until i was 13 years old. I'd told family members, school officials and family friends... No one believed me, often calling me crazy and calling the crazy hospital on me. Finally,  one day... my mother asked me... I lied at first, afraid of being sent back to Bellueve. But, she asked again and I couldn't hold it in. I bared my soul... she also told me that he wasn't my biological father. He semi-confessed to our pastor and it was the pastor that called the police. He was arrested a few days later after he tried to kill me. My mother threw me out and said that God would strike me dead for lying on her husband. I was 13 and homeless. Central park benches and trains were my home.Nine months later, before I was set to testify before the grand jury.. my mother offered me my home back if I retracted my story. I did. He was released and I moved back home.He started with me the very same day he came home. This went on for another three years.. until, I got pregnant with my first son (not his child) He raped me while I was pregnant. That was the last straw. I told my mom and again i was out of a home. So, I began prostituting; to feed my son and myself. I lived this lifestyle for two years, all the while dating this young man...just a few years older than me. He found out what I was doing and moved  my son and I into his home. We married a year later. It's been a troublesome 11 years..  and although we've recently divorced I am still here! I am the mother to five and half(currently expecting) beautiful children, I am a published author,  a business owner and soon to be a college graduate.

136598840398995_138132413578971,"[LONG TEXT INCOMING][FRENCH IN COMMENTS].I was 6, maybe 5. I’m not even capable of remembering how many times it has happened, how long it lasted. Days, weeks, months, years ? I have no idea. Which is ridiculous when I can picture exactly some images, gestures, sounds, tastes. My memory is full of mysteries that I prefer not to know about. I don’t want to torture myself anymore.I couldn’t remember any of it until I was 11 or 12. My first crushes brought my first flashbacks with them. I can still feel it today, the intriguing taste of that first kiss, followed a few minutes later by a monumental slap in my face : it wasn’t the first. I wanted to scream, to throw up, to cry. Something broke inside of me at this exact moment, and it was only the beginning of a long and painful road of tears, aversion and hatred.I couldn’t tell my parents until I was 18. I didn’t want them to know because I didn’t want them to suffer. I did not want to burst with anger the family they founded with love. But at the same time, I wanted them to finally understand, so that they could support me. Selfishly, I also wished they would choose a side. They supported me in their way, but they could never make a choice between their children, and I can’t blame them for that even if it still hurts.I couldn’t help blaming myself until I was 19, after I figuratively slapped myself and went to a doctor to talk about the depression I had been dragging around for so long.Today I am 22. I am indulgent with myself, I can talk about what happened to me without crying (well, obviously not right now but you get the idea), and I still have a long way to go. And I think that I took a step forward today, sharing my story here with total strangers without caring that people I know could read it too. I think that what did not kill me is finally beginning to make me stronger. It was about time.I’ve wanted justice for years, until I understood that justice would never bring me what I want. That nobody would ever sentence so many years later a boy who was 12 at the time only based on vague memories, even if he was scholastically 3 years ahead of children his age and under the influence of 15-years-olds, even in an era where free pornography is and was already accessible to anyone capable of ticking the case saying « I am 18 or older », even in a society where boys are raised thinking they have to have sex to fit in. Because in France today, we can’t see that a teen has access to these images and could be tempted to reproduce them, and a loud minority wearing pink and blue still refuses that we give sexual education to our children. They’re scared of what sexual education might inspire to kids. I’m scared of what no sexual education might continue to inspire them.",Blandine Où C'est,,status,,2017-10-17 16:52:41,6,1,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,0

136598840398995_138117880247091,Thought I'd share my story... It's happened on 2 seperate occasions with 2 different men so bare with me (1st occasion) I was 13 years old on holiday with my family... It was a Tuesday at roughly 7:45pm (we was on a cruise) and we just left the French coast and I saw this crew member who was very very friendly with me.... He had just finished duty and invited me down somewhere... Naive little me went with him... Only to find out he was taking me to his cabin completely off bounds to guests.... I froze... But eventually he made me go down there.... He took me into his room (God knows how we didn't get caught) and he played some music and grabbed my face and forced me to start kissing him... He took pictures of me.... I ran to the door scared and upset and he kept grabbing me and because my voice was gradually raising and he obviously didn't want to get caught he let me go (long story short this is by the way) we told staff and they promised he was fired and would never be allowed to work on board one of their cruise ships ever again..... He's now back on board their ships as a waiter.... (2nd time.... I was 14) Okay so me and my best friend was really close obviously and I got a chance to meet my best friends dad.... Anyway me and my best friends dad (we will call him Paul as I don't want to reveal his real name) me and Paul was making general chit chat and he was telling me about how he got sexually abused as a child which lead me to talk to him what happened to me when I was 13 (story above) to find out we had a lot in common.... He grew attracted to me but as I was 14 I knew this was wrong so I kept telling him to try and get rid of these feelings... Anyhow he couldn't get rid of these feelings and I eventually grew quite found of him as he was giving me all this positive attention which is lacking elsewhere.... And of course naive little me went along with it and we ended up having sex (I lost my virginty to him) he was a 38 year old man.... I knew this was wrong but was scared of leaving him as he had suicidal tendencies and I wasn't going to responsible for someone's death so when the police was enquiring about me and him (as people was getting suspicious) I covered mine and his back and eventually the police backed off and dropped the case.... I 'cheated' on him with my a lad my age (he's now my ex) to get out but we must of had sex about 20 times over and now it's affecting me in terms of certain things remind me off him.... Last I heard of him he's still living his life as normal and been dating women his own age I was sexually bullied in my first year of college by who I thought was my made.... She assumed I was pregnant and made me do a pregnancy test in a busy public toilet with the door wide open so everyone could see me... I was scared of this girl because she had bullied me previously and knocked my self esteem so low..... But yeah that's the story of me!!!Share your stories guys and gals!

There are others that have watched others be abused and think it is okay to be abused and to abuse. Stand up for yourself and others if you can. If you can't that's fine too.

I didn't know that fear, harassment and assault was going to be a recurring theme throughout my life; an ongoing, heavy and constant unspoken anxiety every time I left the house. I didn't know that my peers and some family members would tell me that I deserved it, that I asked for it, that I had better learn my lesson. I didn't know that I would be called a liar, an idiot, a bitch and a slut by those who were meant to protect me. I didn't know that my school would tell me I should have screamed when it happened as a teenager. When I moved to London and it happened again, I didn't know the police were going to shrug and assume I probably wanted it. I didn't know I would be interrogated or that my father would be questioned about my sexual preferences in a separate room. I can't count all of my encounters with sexual abuse and harassment on both of my hands, but I can count those who understood and didn't judge me on one.  To my friends, acquaintances and strangers who have stepped forward with the courage to tell other survivors that they are not alone: Thank you.Thank you for being so strong and sharing something so profoundly painful and personal. You have empowered me to follow in your footsteps. I love you all. <3",Jasmin SG,,status,,2017-10-17 12:19:18,8,3,0,2,3,0,0,3,0,0

136598840398995_138019410256938,":  I was sexually abused by my mother and her boyfriends from ages 6-8, then later in life at age 19, I was raped by a co-worker.  I was so ashamed, I didn't share the incident with my husband for 2 weeks.  We were having problems in our marriage, he accused me of having an affair (because I felt differently) so I ended up forced to inform him of the rape and do the one thing I dreaded doing, calling the police.  I wasn't treated as a victim of a violent crime by the police I was treated as whore that was out getting her kicks and that I fabricated the story to get my husband back (as if being raped would make him come running back).  I was told I was lying because; I no longer had the clothes I was wearing, I had no marks and I was too hysterical after 2 weeks had past. I was probably asking for it the way I was dressed (sweats and a black t-shirt are so provocative).  I soon regretted calling them.  The cops and my husband made me feel ashamed that I had been violated, instead of helping me.  I looked at the officers dead in the eye and told them ""This is why woman don't call the cops in these situations, but handle things on a street level.""  Told them they were nothing but chauvenist pigs, and sent them on their way.  After that day, I endured 2 years of physical, mental and emotional abuse and even rape by my husband (which I never reported due to the prior incident). I believe he held a grudge against me for the initial rape, and took it out on me on a daily. I lost my strength, my independence, my self esteem and my desire to have any meaningful relationship.  I fully understand why women stay silently.  The fear of judgement is paralyzing, as is second guessing yourself.  Enough people tell you it was your fault, you tend to believe it and second guess your own mind.  This happened almost 30 years ago, it took me 25 years to realize I needed help and to get counceling.  That is not an easy thing to do, just as writing this is not easy either.  She empowered me, we worked through the horrors that haunted me, and I found out how to be strong again, how to raise my self esteem, how to be independent.  IF my story or my recovery can help even one person not be afraid to stand up then so be it, let me put myself out there.   On a side note, I am now working on my Masters in Criminal Justice and I emphasize in all of my CJ classes, that officers need more training on empathy, things are not always as they look.Thank you for having this forum for us to gather, discuss and share safely",Denise Light,,status,,2017-10-17 11:29:30,29,8,0,13,5,0,0,11,0,0

136598840398995_137621086963437,"There has been multiple occasions where I have been sexually assulted. A couple have happened within the last year and a half. I was also sexually assulted by my step father when I was a child. The assult began around the age of 8, maybe even before, and it didn't end until I was 13. This was something I went through on a daily basis as did my younger sister. It took me 15 years to finally come out to my sister about it.I always had a feeling my step-father was hurting her and I learned that to be true. We both came out to our mother shortly after and she took her husband's side. My sister and I lost out mother, brothers, and half our family. We were dragged through court for two years, harressed by family members, friends of family, and peers. He was facing 7 felony charges and took a plea. He is now sitting in country jail for a year, on probation, and will be on the sex offenders list for life. The fight was hell, one of the worst things I've have to go through. I had to dig up memories I've been burring for 15 years.  Even after all that, there are still details I have kept locked away, things I'll never be able to say out loud. I have trouble talking about what happened, even when I was testifying, I was very vague. I constantly think back and wonder if the fight was even worth it because of how much I lost. Being drug through the court process sucked but I'm glad I came out about it. Even though I lost a lot of family, I still had  some who were there every step of the way. I had amazing friends and most importantly I had my sister. She was beyond strong and was what kept me fighting!❤️ He didn't get the convection he deserved but my sister and I got our stories out there and he was seen for what he truly is.Don't be afraid to open your about what happened to you!

When i was 6 my mom was gone somewhere and my dad was in jail and my grandmothers boyfriend beat us both. After that life went on till i was 11 years old my grandmothers boyfriend molested me.

In january 2015 3 boys forced themselves on me when i was homeless and thanks to that i deal with ptsd and my anxiety has doubled. February 4th my birthday my dad hit me and told me to kill myself and called the cops and reported me for a suicide attempt and i spent all night in the hospital alone on suicide watch. And the years between when i was 11 until that birthday my dad was drug using and super abusive to me and my mom. My parents left me behind for drugs and i have no family left to live with or talk to about anything. I feel extremely lost.

136598840398995_137509193641293,"I'm actually a child sexual abuse survivor. There's a link to my story on my profile for those who are interested. I wanted to actually share something that happened to me two weeks ago and how the laws in my state are horrible! Sorry in advance for the long post!I had to go to TJ Maxx by my house and was at the far right corner of the front of the store looking for what I needed. There was a family of four nearby, two other gentlemen looking through things, and me. I was looking through the items when I realized there was a man standing close to me and I could see out of the corner of my eye that he was staring at me and wouldn’t take his eyes off of me. I think as females, most of us deal with this every so often and we just know that some men are disrespectful and have no shame in showing their interest in you, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Sometimes they could follow you around the store, go down the aisles you’re in, stare, etc. I didn’t think anything of it, but it started making me really uncomfortable. I was at the end of the stand and he was to my left. I was crouched down looking through the items and he was standing and he was looking down at me. All of a sudden, I hear him making noises and I believe I was standing at the moment and just looked at him like, “Okay, guess he talks to himself or something.” I kept looking through things and he kept making the noises and kept looking at me and I definitely did not want to make more eye contact with him in fear of giving him the wrong impression. I happen to look at what he was even doing and I realized his hands were in his pockets and he was touching himself through his pants pockets. I was beyond disgusted, I felt dirty, grossed out, and I just took the stuff I had and went to pay. I honestly didn’t know what to feel or how to feel. I think I was mostly in shock and in disbelief. I called my husband who was nearby at a restaurant with his father watching a football game, but I quickly hung up because it was my turn to cash out. I decided to just go on to the next store and I was trying to play it cool but couldn’t. I texted my husband and told him I felt like I could just die. I told him what had happened and I started crying in the store pretending to look through the clothing racks. He said he was on his way. When he finally got to where I was he said he wanted to go back to TJ Maxx and see if we could find him. He was LIVID. My husband is the biggest sweetheart, he isn’t mean, he’s friendly, very sociable, and has a great demeanor. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him this mad. His face was red and his breathing even changed. We walked around the store and the guy had left but I remember what he looked like and so my husband kind of knew what to look for. We went to another store to look around for things and when we left that store the man had just passed by. I told him that that was the guy and we followed him into a store. I told him to stay behind and see if he would do it again or do it to someone else, but the man seemed to think the store was too small, couldn’t find a good spot, or didn’t find anyone he liked. He kept looking at his phone too. He left the store and we followed.By this time, my husband said he needed to approach him and I told him I was not going into Target with him because I was scared he would end up hurting the guy and I didn’t want to be there for it. My husband took off after the guy in Target and I went back to the store and looked around. After a while, I left the store and had texted my husband twice with no answer. I sat down at a bench and was thinking the worst. I thought he could be in Target and there could have been an altercation or something since I wasn’t getting an answer. I finally see my husband walking out with the guy, walking fast, and my husband is just yelling and cursing in his face. I run after them and the guy had taken off walking across the parking lot and I asked my husband what happened and he said the guy won’t be back again. I didn’t notice that the Target security guard and a Target employee had followed my husband out and he told me he had caught the guy doing it to another lady at the back of the store. I lost it. I started crying because it was confirmed and the little bit of hope I had of maybe thinking I saw the wrong thing or that it really wasn't what I saw was gone. My husband surprised the guy and the guy got scared and started walking fast out of the store and apologizing. My husband had told the employee to call security and then he called the mall security. The guy got into his gray Infiniti and the security guard got a picture of his plate and the make and model of his car. His face is all over surveillance video in Target and TJ Maxx.We had to go back into Target and wait on the police. Here’s the part that angers me the most. We spoke to the police officer, he took our IDs, we explained what happened, and he left to make some calls. He asked what I wanted out of this. What would anyone else want? I want this guy to stop doing this to ANYONE. I want him to get in trouble for it. Yesterday, it was masturbating in front of women in public. Today, it could be he touches someone inappropriately, tomorrow he could rape someone, and so on. These are stepping stones. For some disgusting pigs, the more they can get away with, the more they want to try and see what else they can get away with. The police officer came back and said that there is NOTHING in any laws in Florida that state what he did was a crime. The only possible thing could be that he did it to someone under the age of 16 or if he had exposed himself. So in this state, it is okay for a man to find a woman he likes in public and get off on how she looks. That is unacceptable and disgusting. I don’t even know if he has any images of me or of any other women in his phone. The only thing we were able to do is have him banned from the shopping center and if he is caught there, he will get charged with trespassing. Regardless, we gave our thanks to the police officer and to the Target employees who helped us. The Target employees and police officer couldn’t understand how my husband was able to keep his composure, but said they were glad he did because he would’ve gone to jail. I just want people to be aware of their surroundings and if you see something or if it happens to you, say something. Maybe laws in your state are different and something could be done and it SHOULD be done. ",Liliana Malave,,status,,2017-10-16 22:07:37,6,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0
136598840398995_138014466924099," I was 12, my attacker was the 16 year old boy who lived next door.  He babysat me and my sisters when my mom and her boyfriend went out.  One day he came into my room where I was playing with my toys, he closed the door and pushed my bed in front of it so I couldn't escape.  He then pinned me down on my bed with his body weight and held my arms down with his hands.  I didn't tell anyone directly for a long time.  I was in 6th grade when it happened and didn't discuss it with anyone till 9th grade.  It messed me up.  I became angry and withdrawn.  My mom ended up committing me to a psych ward for a month and a half in the summer of 1988 (about a month or so after it occurred) because I lashed out at her and my sisters.  I should have said something to her, my dad, or the doctors but I didn't.  I was ashamed.  I finally talked to my mom about it when I was 19.  I told my dad about it several years later after learning he too had been assaulted when he was young.  I don't talk about it regularly and not everyone who knows me knows.

And then at some point in your life you’re going to go through a “dry spell” and your self worth plummets even further, because now that feeling that you were attractive and that’s why it happened, it’s a compliment that’s why, and when you confided in trusted family they were jealous and that’s why they didn’t believe you, not their fault, it’s a compliment really, none of it was because you were worthless, it’s because of your value that it happened, people take because something is wanted, they don’t take garbage with force-that’s been spinning in your head to cloud the issue and dull the edges-suddenly fractures when no one wants you.

Don't label it gender! Women's organisations regard this as their territory and its funding and leadership. Let's escape that mistake. Violence against women and children is a men's issue and it needs male leadership and work! When I wanted to do work on responsible fatherhood funders and gender/women's organisations would simply not spend money on work with men.

We went to a bar to have a few drinks. I was a little drunk but just chatty and not even close to being totally drunk. Next thing i remember is that i wake up the next morning without any cloth in the bed of my “friends” brother. He was already up sitting in the living room watching footy. I got dressed and just ran out... didnt look at him and pushed everything away from me not thinking about what happened. A month later I left Sydney without ever seeing him again, deleted him on facebook.. He never existed.It worked out really good until sometimes last year when i saw the post of his brother that he died in a motorcycle accident. He hit a tree and was dead immediately. In that moment I remembered what has happened.. all these years i just made myself believe that it was just a dream because i run away. During this time i was seeing someone.. he was there for me .. he was the first one i told what has happened. I know it is still blocking myself in many situations.. but at least i started to open up a bit in sharing and talking about it. And i was shocked. When i told a few others they started to talk as well..  so many of my friends have similar stories to tell.",Amelie Lisa Erd Beere,,status,,2017-10-16 16:13:32,24,5,0,6,5,0,1,12,0,0

These stories help educate and protect women, children, and parents.The 23 year old woman who snowed my parents and ""fell in love"" with me when I was 14 did not follow published statistics. Luckily, my parents brought a counselor in who began questioning after my already troubled self as I spiraled further down. Thank you mom.The tactics of a adult male skating rink employee, who turned out to be a already convicted child molester, were not textbook. And at 13, I learned to no longer get tricked into a car with the promise of speed skates...and become trapped and parked, and then not dropped off until I convinced him that ""this is my home"" (It was not, I walked home) And my parents would not allow the local police to 'bug' me, like they wanted. Thank you again Patricia Barutha Tovar. I was so scared.Although these people and sadly others, altered my life forever, I have found personal triumph and justice through educating my children.

136598840398995_137100123682200," Who was your #HarveyWeinstein? As for me, the first one was my step grandfather when I was a baby til I turned twelve. He would lift me from the bed as I was sleeping (grandma and everyone else were asleep and snug in bed) take me to the kitchen, lay me on the kitchen table where we ate hours later with our family, or take me into the bathroom to assault me. Sometimes he'd wait hiding in/outside the door of the bathroom to assault me.Another was a federal prosecutor sent to champion civil rights for my murdered friends when I was a teen victim and witness of two murders by a racist serial killer in Liberty Park. He said if I told anyone about the sexual assaults he inflicted on me for several weeks before, during and after the trial, the killer would be released on a mistrial and would be free to kill again.Then later in 2014 when the prosecutor became a Chief Justice Federal Judge, I was able to get a recorded admission and gave it to the Sean Reyes, Utah's Attorney General Office, only to be misled and betrayed for years, when they had SECURITY FRAUD INVESTIGATORS investigate the abuse, even though they have a special investigative unit for child sex crimes, didn't even interview the predator (they didn't want to incriminate him) and gave the evidence to the predator (but withheld it from me) so he could retire early with a $203,000 pension and escape all accountability. I was told they wouldn't press charges against their judicial brother because the sexual assaults were misdemeanors. After I found out and protested, they retaliated and placed my transcribed interviews with NO REDACTION of personal information on their website. They gave the predator and the press this information before they gave it to me.Now I am, again, at the mercy of an Attorney General Office that behaved more like they represented the predator. I am currently waiting for the predator enabler to write an Amicus Brief supporting the law that allows victims like me to seek civil damages against the predators who abused us.Think about that for a minute. It has been brought to my attention that if I upset or anger the Utah Attorney Generals office, the Amicus Brief will be weak and my case and others like mine are at risk. This familiar place of being held hostage to predators and their enablers is OUTRAGEOUS and never ending.The Utah Legislature was given 14 days to submit an Amicus Brief supporting my case being heard by the Utah Supreme Court. This is considered a very short amount of time, but they graciously accommodated the time frame given. The UAGO has been given more than two months to submit theirs and still haven't submitted it.Honestly, I feel held hostage by this state victim resources sometimes. They have never followed protocol or victims rights with me and are withholding my GRAMA requests in an effort to silence me and play the constant game of keep away, til I either go away or kill myself. Statistics show that the odds are in their favor.I've learned throughout my life that authority figures and powerful predators tend to have powerful enablers who trade victims like baseball cards. Lucky for them that victims rights aren't enforceable.#GoodOldBoys don't care about victims or future victims when they can cash in on favors or donations to thwart justice for the victims left with the consequences of the predators crimes.I could go on with more examples of bosses, teachers and exes but you get the picture. There are too many silenced victims and people turning a blind eye to further selective justice. #HoldThemAccountable #utpolThank you Kaz Weida for seeing the injustice and reporting the truth while local news mostly ignores it.",Terry Mitchell,Rantt Exclusive: How Utah’s AG Office Failed A Rape Survivor — Twice,link,https://rantt.com/how-utahs-ag-office-failed-a-rape-survivor-twice-8d2b8c81aacf,2017-10-16 15:33:23,24,2,1,5,2,0,0,12,5,0

I truly was innocent. When I was 16 my cousin and her boyfriend asked me to go riding around. I thought it was cool to hang with her. She smoked cigarettes very cool to me. She gave me a drink I asked what it was, she said lemonade. It actually was PGA and pink lemonade. I didn't know til later. I learned to trust no one after this. We picked 2 guys that were friends of her boyfriend, I truly barely remember it. Next thing I know we were in a field and my cousin and her boyfriend were walking off. I remember sitting on the trunk. Next thing I know, I'm laying on the ground. One had my arms pinned the other was pulling my pants off. I was screaming NO!! I tried fighting but I wasn't strong enough. I was a virgin. I lost my virginity, my dignity, my self worth. I lost me. The next thing I remember is my mom picking me up in the front yard. I was covered in blood, semen, mud, my clothes ripped. I begged mom not to call the cops. I passed out. When I woke up I got in a bath and scrubbed and scrubbed but I couldn't get the grossness off me. My shoulder hurt on my left, I looked down I had a tattoo!! I don't know when I got it!! So I carried around my mark of shame. I fell deep into depression. My mom sent me off to a institution. I wouldn't eat. All I did was try and wash the nasty feeling off. My therapist said it was best I was drunk. That if I had fought back more I could've been hurt. I hated myself for being drunk. I could've fought back or I wouldn't have been in the situation.... I still cry and feel helpless. But I've told my kids, my niece's so that maybe they never find themselves in my position. I then married a man at 21 that beat and raped me for 14 years.

We need to help them and provide them with the resources they need to find their voice and take back their life. #SurvivingIsMySuperPower",Teresa Nelson,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214523431389504&set=gm.137271546998391&type=3,2017-10-16 17:17:26,22,2,1,13,8,0,0,1,0,0

This person molested me and threatened me not to say a word, as time went on I was sexually assaulted by 6 different individuals, but I’m truly blessed to be alive. I’ve had nightmares for years, attempted suicide twice when I was younger, fell into deep depression, anxiety, panic attack etc due to my problem past. I was lost, I felt dirty, ashamed, rejected, unloved and unwanted. I shared one time at 16 years old, but I felt no one believed me so I shutdown and remained silent for 20 years. I still remember the day I fell on my knees and cried out to God, He heard my cry. A few years later I started praying for those who abused me, yes it took a while but I wanted to forgive them so I can move on with my life, it was then when I begin to heal. I am in a better place now and I’m very grateful, I won’t lie though, I do struggle with post traumatic stress syndrome but God get me through daily.

It was almost 14 years ago when my body was first violated and I feared for my life. When a man I had looked up to as an older brother stripped away every bit of innocence and pureness of a child away. My parents sheltered me, not letting me go to school birthday sleepovers and surrounded me with people from church believing they were keeping me safe. Instead I was raised in a tiny circle that made me so naive... I didn't know a bit of sexuality or understand all the sexual innuendos that surrounded me... looking back I now realize all the signs I may have picked up if I was educated on my body and the different types of people that destroy our culture even when you rest upon a place that you believed to be your safety zone. My heart bares pain to see the countless people that have gone through a similar situations and countless degrees. My love goes out to you all and hope that you heal.

136598840398995_137382433653969,"First, thank you for giving us a safe place to express our feelings. I noticed a post from someone I do not know that posited whether the tweet by Alyssa Milano was too broad. Her tweet said ""Suggested by a friend: If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote """" as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem."" Alyssa Milano posted today she was informed that  was used in the past by Just Be, Inc. to raise awareness. They were founded in 2006.The stranger's post reads:*Edited: I mistakenly posted two of the exact same quotes. My apologies for not noticing.“Interesting thought...when you say  are you referencing sexual assault? Sexual harassment? Sexism? They are all very different...wondering what people are actually ""metoo-ing"" about...This article shows the original post. 'Write me too if you've been a victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault.'While they all can fall under the same umbrella of inappropriate behavior, I don't have personal experience with all of these. I think its fair to say MOST women have fallen victim to sexism. But I would never claim to understand what's it's like to be raped or pressured for sexual favors in the workplace when all I know and have experienced is sexism and maybe some unwanted advances in the bar back in the day...which are both still not ok.That being said, any and all of it is obviously a huge problem, and I'm glad people are talking about it.I thought for a second about posting on her status but was too afraid to engage. And, she did mention that she was glad that people are talking about it.Moments later I noticed that a high school friend had replied to another friend's post with ""What does say me too mean anyway. Some women think being called sweetie is an assault. Let's just agree that men ca be pigs but it's not and never will be the same as being sexually assaulted or raped!!! Anyone can say me too. Let's not diminish those that have suffered an assault or been raped because a man said something inappropriate!! And a man can be sexually assaulted and raped as well. SMH""I replied without forethought ""  is a trigger for me. However, I believe that if we keep silent nothing will change. Yes, there is a spectrum, but who is to say that a person showing their genitals to a child is not as bad as rape? Or, that a person who touches another person in any way that makes them uncomfortable is not as bad as another form of harassment? A slap on the rear, a grab of the breast, a tongue in the mouth, etc., etc. And, for that matter, how bad was the rape? Was it while drugged, drunk or otherwise incapacitated? Was is by a family member? Was it by a stranger? Was it someone they were dating? Was it by more than one person? Does it matter? People can say  and have it mean the worst thing that has ever happened to them. My list is long and includes some of the things questioned above as well as many other instances that have made me feel damaged. I don't intend this to be mean, especially to you, (friend). I'm just presenting my side of my story. This is about power and I don't want them to have it anymore.""

It takes a lot to give off good energy. I work on it daily. For those who know me... it's probably like Jazz when?? Where??.. My answer is at home! #WhatHappensInThisHouseStaysInThisHouse is Garbage. I will never stand by this... Sexual abuse doesn't just happen with Strangers. A lot of the times it's by close family members & friends. Speak to your children, and STAND BY THEM. LISTEN TO THEM. This shit is real and it happens way too much!!! Watch who you bring around your daughters! I don't care how any one feels. I don't care if I offend anyone. I'm not here for you... Im here for those who need to know it's okay sis!!! You're not alone.  I encourage all the women around the world that if this has ever happened to you don't be a victim... be a Survivor. I don't embrace what has happened to me but damn it it's me. It's made me who I am today.. I turned My Bad to Good, My Weakness to Power, My Insecurities to Courage. I turned to alcohol a few years ago... Mannnn!!!! Smh. But I'm okay! That was part of my healing process. But I never healed. You dont ever really heal. You just deal! You just deal!!!! So I dealt with it. I had to face the fact that it happened.. to me.. as a child into my teens. Unfortunately you kind've deal with alone.. no one ever really wants to believe that their beloved family member is a sexual child abuser. You're a drama queen, you just want attention or you're spoiled. A few fuck yous to the non believers (excuse my English) but it's cool. Anyways back to who matters... Ladies just know its not your fault. You didn't deserve it. Talk to someone. You don't have to go through anything Alone. You deserve to be happy too. Fight depression, don't let it consume you. Be Great!!! This is part of my story. I have a few projects in mind to help spread awareness for it. I'm not drugged out and I have sanity because I'm supposed to help. I was called for it.

Girls and women have made major strides since 1990, but they have not yet gained gender equity. The disadvantages facing women and girls are a major source of inequality.

Naive like I was, I talked back when he started to talk to me.Immediately I noticed that something was wrong. He had very strong opinions about his rights here in Sweden, I was silent all the time and just nodded. Eventually, I picked up the phone to send a text to my boyfriend, but I was told to put it down.He asked me if I was a racist, and I just shook my head. I then went to my contact list without looking down at the phone, and called my boyfriend. I left the phone call going on, and my boyfriend heard quite soon that something was wrong.When we almost had arrived, he stopped me. He wanted to have sex with me, or to quote him: make love to me. No one else needed to know.I panicked. He approached me and we’re on his way to grab me, just then I saw my boyfriend on his bicycle. I ran to him, and the man quickly started to walk away.3 months later we sat in the trial. He was sentenced and paid damages of 5,000: -. Throughout the summer, I was paranoid, and isolated myself.Over the years I have also been with boyfriends who took advantage of me and in some cases, raped me.Men who have looked at my breasts, asked how much I cost, messages that they want sex with me.

136598840398995_137516053640607,"long post alertEvery week before the 15th of January I begin the journey of mourning the death of my mother. I was 17 when I held her in my arms and with my little brother Innocent we felt her take her last breathe. I had scratches and marks over my body but no body knew what happened. I couldn't tell my mother that she needed to stick around longer  because i needed her.. My mother was dying and being village people her family could no longer help with the medical bills. We were being kicked out of our apartment  so my moms family came with a truck and took everything except me and my cousins. They left us with 2 mattresses and a few things as we were still going to high school.  anyway a few days later i get a phone call saying we should go to the village because my mom wasn't getting any better but we had no money to get us there. so I said i would borrow from a friend who i knew had a small video library  (for renting movies) and we would pay him back. I went to his work place which wasnt far from our house and told him my mom was dying and i needed to borrow some money to go be with her. He said he didn't have any cash at the moment but that i could come back next morning to get it. I go back the next morning and the place is closed. I call him and and he says he is down with a fever he cant come to work but if i really need the money I Should go to his house and pick it up.  Some may say, ""that should have been a sign"", but I say,  this was my friend. That i trusted completely! it wasn't some stranger I didn't know. He knew were we lived , he knew my mom. He was a young father as well with a little girl. Anyway I went. I remember clearly what i wore that day. A pair of blue jeans with a short sleeved dress.Getting there, He invites me in and Offers me tea i accept water which is a coming  thing to do for a guest back in my country. He excuses himself to go use the bathroom (most houses were built like that with communal bathrooms. When he got back he locked the door with a key. I told him i wasn't comfortable with him doing that. He told me i was beautiful. I told him to open the door because i needed to go. He began to pull his belt off and i could hhear myself freaking out!  I couldn't believe what was happening.I tried to make for the door and he grabbed me and tried to tie me up with his belt. i kicked and fought and screamed and he hit me so hard i couldn't feel my face. he lifted me and threw me on his bed and when i tried screaming again he punched me over and over. he ran off and grabbed a knife and then placed his hands on my throat the knife besides me. he squeezed  my neck so tight that i couldn't believe i was screaming and nothing was coming out, i'd lost my voice and no one could hear me.  he knelt on my pelvic area and he whispered in my ears and i quote, ""if you try to fight me or scream one more time, i am going to stab you and cut you  into tiny little pieces and dispose of you in the tank on top of building!"".Note that this was one of those 2 storied buildings that had only  the bottom floor completed with tenants living in while the top floor was still under construction. and he as well had a 1 bedroom houseHis  weight over my slim body (and he was plus size man) and the pressure from the pain and for a minute i passed out. i woke up to feeling and watching myself violated, knife next to me in his hand and i cried. he had pulled off my pants and he had his way with me. i kept telling myself your mother is dying, that hurts more. my escape:  his phone rang, it must have been someone important, i always think maybe the mother of his daughetr or mom i dont know, because he took off fast leaving the door closed but unlocked. that is when i put my pants on and ran as fast as i could to the police station. i told them i wanted to report a rape and they sat  me down to wait until someone was available to take my statement. almost 3 hours of waiting and finally a female officer  took my statement. she asked me to go to a clinic whose address she gave me and told me to take 25.000 shs to get a rape kit done. i had no moneyI  i was in this position because of  NOT having money and i wasnt getting any justice because i didnt have it. so i had to walk over 2 hours to go ask my aunt that lived outside the city center for help and all she gave me was the exact UGX 25.000 which was about 12 US dollars at the time.  I had to walk 2 hours back and it was getting dark , i hated the skin i was wearing  i hated myslef i just wanted to wash this feeling off.  so i kept the 25.000 for my rape kit and decided to use it as transport to go see my dying mother and walked back home only to find that mf at my house. i told my couseins what had happened and we sent him away . i spent hours scrabbing myself trying to celan off this feeling.  I was 17 and my mother was dying. and so it goes on and on. people asked what happened when i got to the village and i said i had an accident but i know they must have known because my cousins must have told but nobody helped me get justice.It was the 8th of January 2007 that makes me say . my mother died a week later on the 15th of January 2007 and the old Naive, trusting me died with her. I did not dress up in a way that asked for this, i had a bald head for fuck's sake, u know how school grooming requires it in Uganda, but i guess i went through too much hell all at once that what i have now feels like heaven. sharing my story isn't so i get pity. its to show that just because someone takes long to speak about their experiences with sexual abuse, doesn't mean it didn't happen. I am stronger than before, I'm smarter , and I am a happy person and i have my beautiful family to show for it.",Esther P. Van Tuijl,,status,,2017-10-16 22:18:01,37,3,0,8,11,1,0,17,0,0

At least once a week for a whole year he would pull me into his room so we could 'play house', you know my mom freaked out when she found me changing in the same room as my cousin - a boy who has never treated me as anything other than a sister and yet she never questioned the fact that her little girl spent all her time with a teenager and she never questioned it a year later when that same little girl would scream every time someone tried to touch her. I ignored those memories and what they meant for 10 years until i fell into depression for the first time, i convinced myself that it didnt matter what happened to me because my body didnt matter and if my body didnt matter then i couldn't be molested - it didn't matter when boys groped at my chest, it didn't matter when an upperclasman stuck his hand down my shorts, and it didn't matter that the same man sat next to me on the city bus every morning just so he could touch my legs. I didn't matter, i believed that so completely that when boy i was friends with started making advances towards me i let, i allowed myself to be pulled into a toxic, emotionally abusive relationship where i was almost forced to use my virginity as a bargaining chip just so i wouldn't have to be alone.

136598840398995_137157050343174," I was at a friends family party last October. It was fancy dress and I was 15 I shouldn’t have been drinking but I was an irresponsible teenager. Since this guy (Let’s call him Liam) was a family member to one of my closest friends (Let’s call him Austin) I thought I could trust him, but I thought wrong. I lay on Liam’s shoulder in the living room (small house so everyone was still around) and Austin’s mum placed a blanket over us because I said I was cold. Liam had his hand on my hip because I was lying on his fake boob as a pillow and had my legs on the couch. His fingers started circling my hip and before I knew it he was groping my ass, since I felt uncomfortable I pulled his hand away and he went back to circling his fingers around on my hip again. He did this twice more and then went up and slowly groped my left boob to the point where I felt like a fucking sex toy. When he did this, I tried to pull his hand away but he wouldn’t let go until I pulled again the third time harder. He went back to circling on my hip (at which point I was terrified because I was like why tf is a 27 year old man trying to fucking grope me), I was confused and scared and didn’t know what to do. Bearing in mind as I said this was in a room full of people including Austin, his big sister and a three year old boy and so I didn’t want to randomly get up and cause a scene plus I was shocked and panicked. Finally, Liam went from my hip and slipped his hand under my pants over my underwear and got about an inch away from touching me when my Austin’s  mother asked me where I was sleeping for the night (as I was staying there too). I said I was staying downstairs with Austin as I thought and she asked Liam where he was staying too (I didn’t know he was staying until she asked him) and he said “Oh I’ll stay down here then”. Austin said “oh well if you and dad are sleeping down here then me and Caitlin will go and sleep upstairs” and then when I told Austin he said it wasn’t a big deal and Liam probably didn’t know what he was doing. I rang my boyfriend and he was completely livid.I honestly honestly believe it would’ve gone a lot further if 1) Austin’s mum hadn’t stepped in when she did and 2) If I’d have slept downstairs.The day after I went down and Liam was acting completely normal and (this happened on a Saturday) the Thursday after he messaged me trying to have a normal conversation. I told him what he’d done and he remembered none of it and called me a liar and told me he could lose his job if a stupid little girl like me didn’t shut my mouth and quit making things up. I told my psychologist at the time and he told my family and the police and they got it all sorted for me. It honestly shook me up so much and Was probably one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me. Not many people know and it isn’t as bad as most on here but I wanted to share because it makes me feel better. Sorry it’s so long.

136598840398995_137193193672893,I was about 9 or 10 when my sister's dad raped me. He said he wasn't gonna actually do it and that I would still be a virgin but when i went to the bathroom with my mom and i wiped there was a lot of blood and my mom knew what had happened without saying anything. Neither of us reported him cuz he said that if we did he was gonna kill whoever put him in jail and that CPS was gonna take me from my mom...we were scared of him. My mom finally at last got rid of him when I was 16 but it wasn't till I was 18 when I finally told someone about it and when I did I cried...not only cuz I felt as if it was my fault but also cuz it felt good to finally talk to someone about it.

I went to a counselor at my university and went through the process of reporting him because my counselor was required to report it. It was the scariest and hardest thing I've ever done, but he ended up being suspended from my university for 2 years. So many strangers knew my story because so many people were involved in the process. I shut down and dropped out of school because I no longer felt safe.

I can forgive him because he didn't know any better. He was only a year older than me, and had severe autism. What I can't forgive was people refusing to believe it until my mom walked in on it. Next came my exes. Not just one or two. But almost all of them. Many of them dated me just for sex. One of them took it upon himself to force himself on me multiple times after we had broken up.

I remember it being so manipulative and she was ""nice"" to me trying to get me to take my clothes off and get in bed with her. At 5, I watched my older sister molest little boys in her bedroom. I'm not sure how she led them in there. Neighbors' kids. When I turn 7 and 8 my older sister would beat me, mentally and emotional abuse me. Mostly yelling at me calling me stupid, ugly, useless and made me clean the entire house while she yelled. My mom would leave for weeks at a time for her job and left me with that monster. She threatened to kill me several times.I was then raped at 17 but I didn't think it was that at the time. I blamed myself for being there at his house without his parents home.I tried to get help when I was an adult....go to a psychiatrist, but my mom was against it because she thought I should go see a spiritual priest instead. I didn't tell her I was going because of being molest it. I mean, I told her when it happened. But, I was just afraid she would support the monster if I reminded her and I would be even worse a mess. I never got supported and the abuse continued until I stopped talking to my entire family just this year. My entire family is sick and abusive one way or the other. Judgmental, passive aggressive behavior that would constantly trigger me to believing I was nothing and incapable of taking care of myself. I was diagnosed with PTSD and my psychiatrist literally told me to stop communicating with them because my medication wasn't working. It was a huge relief to hear because for the first time ever, someone was on my side and gave me permission to walk away. So, I stop talking to them for a few weeks but, I went back to talking them feeling guilty. You know you get people that say, ""That's your mom. You should always speak to her. She gave birth to you."" Yeah, but she also supported an abuser and continued to do so. Now, I'm 41 with one daughter and alone.

Sí quizás fue un poco mucho…. “pero, Esther, han sido amigos tanto tiempo, no seas así”. Estas has sido las respuestas de amigos cercanos, amigos a quienes amo, amigos en quienes confío, cuando les comentaba el por qué no quería que este hombre sea parte de mi vida. Porque según yo, me había violentado. Según yo sí era para tanto como para no volver a hablarle a esa persona. Tantas veces me quisieron hacer sentir que YO era la que estaba equivocada, que YO era la que estaba haciendo las cosas mal… “No es para tanto.”No es para tanto que cuando el Andrés Torres, quién había sido mi mejor amigo decidió aprovecharse de que yo estaba completamente borracha, tanto que no podía ni moverme después de vomitar, que decidió desvestirme en el cuarto oscuro, en un colchón que puso en el suelo, y decidió que intentaría penetrarme y luego dejarme desnuda para que mi mejor amiga de ese tiempo me vista. No es para tanto que luego le llamé y nunca me dijo la verdad, me dijo “ay, no es para tanto, estas loca” Después de que la doctora me confirmó que habían rastros de penetración, que MI CUERPO mostraba señales de lo ocurrido, señales de penetración FORZADA y AUN ASI habían personas que no creían los hechos.No es para tanto que cuando me volví a emborrachar en una fiesta y me fui a acostar en una cama hubieron varios hombres que entraron al cuarto y me dieron nalgadas, pensando que era un juego de risas, me daban una nalgada y salían corriendo del cuarto. No es para tanto que yo solo quería pasar la borrachera y estos hombres aprovecharon el momento para “hacerse los chistosos”. No es para tanto… que cuando salí del cuarto llorando y gritando preguntando quién fue, todos se reían de mi y NUEVAMENTE me dijeron que estaba loca y que “no es para tanto ve!”No es para tanto que cuando estuvimos en una fiesta tomando todos y bailando, disfrutando mi ida a Estados Unidos que el David Terneus aprovechó nuestro estado… se acercó a mi y me besó sin que yo le diera permiso. “Ay Esther, no es para tanto, déjale, es el Chuki”. Ya, sí, pero Y YO?? No es para tanto que cuando le mandé al carajo él mismo me dijo “Ay ya TETIWARS, no es para tanto!” No es para tanto, que cuando decidí cortar comunicaciones con él, aún habían personas que me decían que le deje nomás, que así mismo es él. Y qué de mi decisión? Acaso yo estaba tan mal?No es para tanto que cuando nos quedamos a dormir en la casa del CHICO él me dijo que “por ser mujer puedes dormir en mi cama tranquila yo duermo en el sofá” para luego sentir su cuerpo cerca del mío intentando sacarme los interiores. Yo atemorizada de que me vuelvan a decir “Ay, Esther no es para tanto” no le puteé ese rato, me tragué las lagrimas y solo le dije YA BASTA! NO! Y me quedé callada, pero emputada. Solita… porque a la final no es para tanto…ME han dicho que no es para tanto tantas veces. Que soy una exagerada. Que quizás fue mi culpa. Que no debí haber tomado tanto… Tantas veces que empecé a matarme yo solita en silencio.La única vez que logré decir algo y que los que “me quieren” estuvieron a mi lado fue después de que el Oscar Tafur, quien decía amarme con todo su ser, decidió una noche empujarme contra la pared desde el cuello, sostenerme ahí gritándome y sosteniendo un cuchillo a su estómago. Cuando él mismo decidió dejar marcas moradas en mis brazos. Solo en ese momento mis amigos y amigas me dijeron que le deje de hablar, que yo no me merecía ese tipo de trato. SOLO AHI,Que alguien por favor me explique cual es la diferencia. Todo lo descrito anteriormente es violencia! Es abuso! Todo lo descrito anteriormente ESTA MAL!Y aún así, me he llevado sus palabras, y ahora me encuentro aquí intentando encontrar mi voz que ha sido silenciada tantas veces porque las cosas que me han ocurrido “no son para tanto.” Aquí me encuentro intentando luchar contra lo que creo que está bien y lo que me han hecho pensar que está bien, que no es para tanto. Aquí me encuentro encontrándome a mi misma nuevamente a mis 27 años de edad. Aquí me encuentro llorando varias noches al mes sin poder creer que me sentía tan sola, tan estúpida, tan confundida en tantos momentos. Y aun así habrán personas que lean esto y dirán que fue mi culpa porque el alcohol, que fue mi culpa por salir con tal y cual persona, que fue mi culpa…. QUE FUE MI PUTA CULPA. Personas que querrán que yo sienta eso. Que protegerán a los agresores porque a la final ellos no son perfectos, porque a la final ellos son hombres y no pueden aguantarse la ganas de VIOLENTAR EL CUERPO DE UNA MUJER.Pero, sabes que. Ahora me encuentro aquí buscando mi voz. Entendiendo que yo tomo mis propias decisiones y que si no te quiero volver a hablar esa es MI DECISION y nadie tiene por qué decirme que YO SOY LA QUE ESTA MAL.A mis 27 años empiezo a perdonarme a MI MISMA y a decir BASTA!

One day I went to fetch salad dressing to re-stock from the walk-in fridge it was in a mall and the area was very secluded you had to walk through a long hall and then get to the fridge. When I got there he was inside I was already very uncomfortable. His skeezy smile made me cringe and I tried to ignore him and just get what I needed and leave as soon as possible. But then he started the flirting again and I ignored him and then he got angry and grabbed my you know what. And I screamed and punched him. I then managed to break loose and there was a cart in between us with big bottles of salad dressing and I kicked it over towards him and they went flying on him. Then I ran away. I told my boss as soon as I got back to the salad bar, I told him I was going to report him to mall security. The boss got angry at ME saying he didn't want ""trouble"" And its bad for business and they were friends so he was obviously protecting him. He told me to ""slap him in the face next time"".

Why being male always have to destroy the purity of women in such a horrible way..right from childhood to old age ..?We seems to be in a civilized society or world but in reality we are in hell. It's not about harassing or molesting ...it's about psychological disorders from my point of view.Sexual assaults are the biggest sins of one's life who commits it on the weaker section of the society..But I felt strong and good that atleast the respected ladies around the world are opening up strong and bold to fight within themselves to overcome the fear  against molesters , rapists , sexual assaulters etc.Gradually the entire world will be with you all. But general awareness needs to be spread across the globe through seminars , rally's , street plays , drama , concerts , painting competitions , story tellings , dancing competitions ,singing competition, sports , movies social platforms etc ...in the same time .We will do it very soon in our country India.

Once he hurt me so bad i tried to push away from him. He whipped me and told my mother i peed in my panties. Another time he made me take a bath with some bugs in the tub. I cried and passed out. My family thought i jad an epileptic seizure. My family took me to the doctor said i just had sand burns. There did come a time when i was sent out of town and when i came home he wasn't there anymore. I was fourteen when i was raped by a friend. Of a boy i was seeing. My first husband had to beat up on me and forced me to have sex with him. His abuse lasted for 2 years. I finally broke out of all of this and started to like myself at forty. I turn 65 in February. The idea when i was little is not to talk about it. I tried to kill myself when i was 15, because I didn't know how to handle it or talk about it. Thank you for letting us share this.

I never outed the neighbor who molested me for years starting at 11.I reported the cop who sexually assaulted me. It was a very long painful and psychologically damaging process. Going through the legal system re-victimized me. And was not resolved until 8 years later. This NJ cop was never put on the sex registry, and although he was a serial offender, he served very little time (4 or 5 years away from the prison population). These two incidences are the most tramatic, but there were many incidences of sexual harrassment and inappropriate touching, grabbing, etc.At least I know that I did the right thing by reporting the assault by this cop. Unfortunately, reporting doesn't guarantee that the perpetrator will be punished, that you will get any kind of closure, that Anything will happen, except your pain.

I was getting ready for bed one night in my foster mom's room, I went to lay down when my fosterdad came in I thought nothing of it because I was almost asleep and i had school in the morning. He climbed into the bed and turned me around and started touching me down there. It hurt so I told him to stop. He eventually did and said ""tell anyone and I'll kill you"" his words still make me shiver. Anyways I didnt tell anyone, Because I was scared of someone who was supoosed to keep me safe..... I FINALLY told my dads gf in 7th grade on the way to school, It felt weird but Ive already held it in for so long. I told my older brother when i was 16 he said he didnt believe me and that i was just looking for attention. Ever since then we havent really been close like we used to be in fostercare. Thats when all the counseling started which didnt help at all. My dad took me to this place that was an investigation place i think? There was rooms with the 2 way mirrors which freaked me out so we left.  Its been 14 years and im still sitting here asking My self why I didn't go through with this sooner.

I punched him in the face, I was suspended, he was not. 14- was told to get out and walk the 3 miles home from where we were parked because I didn’t want to have sex with him in the back of his car.15- Lost my virginity to a guy I barley knew because he was older and I felt pressure from my peers because I hadn’t lost it yet. 15- after weeks of convincing I sent my boyfriend “nudes” he showed them to every person he knows, it was years before I stopped hearing about it.15- I begun a romantic relationship with someone 12 years older than me. It took me many years to realize he was a predator.17- After a night of drinking I was blackout drunk. I woke up the next morning with a man I thought was a friend but who I had never expressed in any interest in. I asked him what happened and he said “well you didn’t stop me”",Adria Wheary,,status,,2017-10-16 18:53:35,8,3,0,0,3,0,0,5,0,0

136598840398995_137381833654029,"Thank you guys so much for your stories. You guys strengthen me. My name is Holley Noelle Robison. I hail from Utah. I cant tell you how old I was, I cant remember most of my childhood before age 13. But I was raped by my cousin. I tried to tell my Dad, but he didn't believe me. I didnt tell anyone else till I was 19 years old.I started becoming an advocate for other's when I became an author of the book ""The Gift of a Friend"" It's not a New York's bestseller (Mainly cause it's available for free on my site holleynoellerobison.com) but I've had 23 people come to me to tell me that they were abused and hadn't told anyone about it but me. Their stories stregthened me and made me more vocal. I had a man come to me the other day and tell me he was raped by a woman and tried to tell the police but wasnt believed. I'm still visibly angry every time I think about it. But when someone confides in you like that, you can't back down. I remember I was 14 and Mariska Hargitay came out with the Joyful Heart foundation and she had similiar experiences (Although on a much bigger scale) of people telling her their story. She said the same thing.Seeing these  stories today just makes me sad, but also quite proud. Cause a few of the people who have confided in me, have come out with their story. Something they thought they could never do. I share all this cause I know there is strength in numbers. I also know how hard it is to open your mouth and say something. I told my Bishop first, and it was another year before I said anything else, to anyone. If you need me to be your voice, I will be. If you need someone to talk to, I am here. In December, I am running a charity Event in Utah, if you're in the area. If not, we will be livestreaming it as well.I love you guys, and be strong.

136598840398995_137379126987633,"  I know you guys have been seeing this on Facebook and I have been wondering when my heart was ready to open up and talk about all this. Apparently, its on a plane to Disney World. This year, I have been talking to as many women as possible about their experiences with love, life and sex (OMG taboo!!) I have learned so much from hearing their stories and what they have been through to discover themselves. I appreciate it so much. As women, we are conditioned to be pink. As women, we are conditioned to be a wife. As women, we are conditioned to be a mom. As women, we are conditioned to be part of the support team and not the lead. I don't consider myself a feminist, labels aren't my thing unless its the Poop Queen. I just believe as humans, we have the power to change lives. We have the power to change our lives, we have the power to love others and build belief in others. I am grateful that I was raised by a father that believed in me. He told me I could do anything I set my mind to. He told me that I could be the President of the United States if I wanted too. Being raised with such great belief has given me the strength to chase my dreams, believe in myself and that I know I deserve a big life of whatever I want and put my mind to. Not all girls are this lucky to have such an amazing dad. My dad also taught me that there are two types of dudes: dogs and men. He told me many men are dogs and that I am better off alone than with a dog. Wow. Powerful. Think about that for a minute. Dogs belong in the dog house not YOUR house. Talking with all these ladies out there, we sure have a lot of experience with dogs don't we? Unfortunately, it takes an experience with a dog to decide you want a man and aren't willing to waste your time any longer on a dog. I know so many men out there are like my dad and others that are incredible beacons of light and have strong moral character and integrity and support (and uplift!) women. My hats off to you, thank you. Spread the world men! Women truly are the world's greatest untapped resource!!!! But back to the ME TOO.....Have you ever looked at the definition of misogyny? It literally means in Greek to hate women. When men sexually objectify women, they are hating on women. When men lure women in with the purpose of sleeping with them, you are hating on women. When you lie to get what you want, you are on hating women. When men treat women as conquests, you are hating on women. When you are deceitful to a women, you are hating on women. I could go on but you get the point....and if you don't...please let me smack you right quick. For those men above, if you have a sister, daughter or female friend....shame on you!!! Do you want this done to the women in your life??? Do you want your daughter coming to you crying because a man did something to her....something that YOU are doing to other women as well????I have had the unfortunate experience lately of seeing these types of men first hand. I hate seeing this in my community because there is not a place for it. I have zero tolerance for this behavior now. There is a Japanese Proverb that says....if you are unsure of the character of a man, look at his friends.Ladies, women, girls, females, babes......we have worked too damned hard and made it this damn far to allow this type of behavior in men. I stand with you when you say NO to the dogs out there. You are worthy of a partner that treats you with respect, integrity and that has character.To my ladies, you are Wonder Women. You have the power to conquer the world and be anyone you want to be.The scars from that the ME TOO have left on you, on us...together we can heal, we can share stories together, we can grow from them and we can be stronger. We can teach the next generation that we have the ability to change the world!!!And hey....I will lighten the mood a bit with this pic.

She walked home about 7 miles and was passed up and not given a ride by family members who saw her. This was back in 1965. Later on, my mother became a drug addict. I now understand that the trauma she experienced caused her to want to numb out through drugs and alcohol. Eventually, she got clean through 12 Step Recovery and went to therapy. But I can't help but think how different her life and mine would have been if she could have been helped and supported back then. I, too, have been date raped; sexually preyed on by an employer and experienced domestic violence with a partner who I finally called 911 on.

But I am happy that through communities like this, we can realize we are not alone, and that together we can change our mysonigist, patriarchal culture. It won't be easy, but there are things we can do.-If you are comfortable doing so, tell your story to anyone who will listen, and to those who should hear it. Keep telling it. Write it down, publish it, share with others.-Shut down anyone who says ""Why didn't you (or she/he) tell someone about this earlier? or ""Why didn't you (she/he) call the police? What were you (she)  wearing? -Boycott products/companies or organizations who just don't get it, or somehow promote or accept sexual harassment. I used to by DKNY clothing, but no more after Donna Karen's  comments about women ""asking for it"" when they wear suggestive clothing. I am going to write a letter to the company to let then know why I am no longer buying their products.-Get to know your state and local politicians. Send them emails, letters or call them to protest any current laws or pending legislation that takes away or limits protections for domestic  abuse, rape or assault. For example, in my home state of Minnesota, I just learned that domestic abuse is NOT a reason  for police officers to be terminated, thanks to specific legislation written by a state representative 10 years ago. -If someone makes you feel  uncomfortable with dirty jokes, pornography, or inappropriate comments of any kind, tell them in no uncertain terms you will not tolerate it.

He approached and smiled at me, so I nicely smiled back and went back to what I was doing. He told me he thought I was pretty…which was initially flattering, but he got closer, and I was confused, so I moved to the side and ended up with my back to the lockers. He said,""Don't be so shy, why are you shy all the time?"" I told him I wasn't being shy. Then he shoved me against the lockers and pinned my arms. As I struggled and tried to turn away, he tried to forcefully kiss me. ""You know you want this,"" he hissed at me. After I continued to struggle away, he finally released me and said, ""Fine, whatever,"" as he dropped his arms and walked away.  I remember shaking and trying not to cry.

Oh and waking up at 6am while sleeping over in a friend's house to find her partner (who I've know for 10 years) standing over my bed with his cock in his hand. I do think the focus needs to be turned on the perpetrators though, and what it is that makes them lose their humanity to such and extent that they do that?  Of the people I knew that sexually assaulted me, all of them had some kind of mental health issues and at least one was abused as a child.

136598840398995_137102737015272,"  Thank you for making this group!I had to push a male classmate off me in 7th grade. Then he bragged and I reported it to the school. He was removed from all my classes. My step-dad made a joke about raping me when I was 14 if I didn't do his laundry. I started keeping knives and short wooden spears (yes, really) in my bedroom, and hidden around the house and the property. I started taking martial arts. One night, I had to jump on his back, kick against a sideboard and yank him off my mother, because he went from yelling to getting physical in 5 seconds flat and *no one* touches my mother. I was 16.A male friend (married) in college assaulted me on multiple occasions. I had no witnesses, and felt no one would believe me because he was ""the gregarious touchy flirt who doesn't mean it"" until he did it to another woman, and then I told a male friend who I decided would finally listen. At which point the asshole's wife left him.Then more male 'friends,' including married. Then a couple photographers I modeled for. Then a boss, who expected me to do a threesome with him AND MY MOTHER. My mother wouldn't give him the time of day, but didn't do anything solid to protect either of us, because she didn't see him as a threat. But he was.And none of that even touches on a pedophile dad. Or my ""uncle's"" child porno photos.None if this is an exaggeration.I've known I was gay since before I knew ""lesbian"" was a real thing -- I had a crush on my mom's best friend when I was a kid. And my step-sister. The jerks did not ""turn me gay.""The list of guys in my friends circle, whether we were ever a benefits thing or not (because they weren't an asshole and accepted ""gay""), and who I completely trust, love and respect, (gay or straight) is incredibly small. Like, I'm hard-pressed to say ten names.A man calling me ""masculine"" is actually a huge insult. A man telling me to grow my hair long because it's pretty, or get my nails done, pisses me off. A lot. Which *somehow* is not remotely comprehended. Especially if it's by a man old enough to be my father. Technically older, as my father is dead.I'm a dyke. And an artist who went to college for a decade because I was not going to live my life being told I couldn't be an artist because I am a woman.I project being a nice, undamaged person. I don't like projecting as angry at every male on the planet, because I have *way* more important things to do.

All I can say is that it has - among other - shaped me into someone who is whole/ balanced today and does not focus on the pain these experiences may have caused; they are not directing my life, yet may have influenced the level of my resistance; I guess they made me stronger, more determined: Whenever I witness such things happening, I interfere or speak up, and I hope to be able to keep doing that. It remains difficult though, a conscious effort. Having seen so many of you courageously coming forward today, made me aware that I must at least give away: I am one of you. But I do not believe the concept of power and forced upon submission, the idea of superiority and inferiority can be abolished and disappear; it seems an inherent trade of human ways to think and act along those patterns, be it between the sexes, be it between nations when fuelling war or the way humans treat animals (and easily degrade a woman, a child, anyone perceived as an opponent or just as 'in the way' to the rank of animals). Sexual abuse goes much deeper than we can fathom at first sight. - This is why I wish all of you a healing, prosperous life, peace of mind and the ability to defend yourselves and others wherever necessary, then move on, not look back at old pain for too long. - Love - Nic",Nio Cillín,,status,,2017-10-16 15:13:52,5,1,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,0

My mother lost everything as she began to use drugs to numb her situation, and ended up living in a Cemetery, which meant she could no longer care for me. So she decided it would be in my best interest to go stay with my step father which had remarried to a woman who had two sons. (My bio-father didn't want me). By this time I was 4-6 years old and my step mother and father didn't have much them selves but we did have a roof over our heads and food in our tmmies and a bed to sleep in and a room I had to share with my teenage stepbrothers ... Late at night when my parents would go to bed, I could remember (we will call him Freddy) Freddy would creep to the living room in the trailer we lived in to make sure no one else was awake and proceed back to my bed to do his deeds. I can remember it like it happened last night. This went on for a couple of years, until one night my step dad had to go to the bathroom and caught him in the act. That was the night I had to leave everything and everyone behind that I knew to be shipped off to live with my grandparents. While my step brother faced no kind of punishment bc my step mother didn't want to loose her food benefits.. for years and years I blamed myself and tried self harm and a lack of trust for anyone . When I turned 20, I had a beautiful baby girl who gave me reason. I am now 26 years old, with two amazing children and a wonderful loving supportive fiance.

It took me over 30 years to speak up. Not because I did not know how but the transparency and closer that I needed. I was left alone to be improperly touched by a cousin. I knew it was not right but I never spoke up in fear of what my dad or brothers would do to him and they would get in trouble. So I stayed quiet. I was sleeping in my room and I  get another inappropriate touch in the middle of the night with my brothers and parents sleeping not far away. I keep quiet again out of fear of what would happen to them.

Also, because the perpetrator was a father figure and somebody I completely trusted, it took me long to understand the act. The molestation continued till 4 years when I finally decided to tell a female family member who asked me not to mention the incident to anyone ever and 'thanked God that I was ""only molested"" and not raped.' As, I'm writing this, I feel cowardly and cringe at the idea of people reading it and judging me. I wish I could say I have moved on from this 'just molestation' and how it made me stronger. But, it didn't. I'm still not over it and I still don't want to talk about this painful personal episode. The incident left me so scarred that every time I see a kid alone with a chachu, nanu, mamu or papa, I’m scared. But, sometimes it becomes your responsibility to come forward and share it.

136598840398995_136879707037575,"First time a man came at me sexually, I was 11 - he was a family friend in his 60s. I didn’t know about sex-just had a feeling that it was wrong when he put me on his lap, behind the barn, and tried to put his hand in my pants. I jumped off and ran. Thereafter, every time he saw me he gave me a quarter. It was “hush” money. I didn’t say anything because it was 1961 and, tho a child, I would have been blamed and I didn’t understand what was going on. Same for adolescence and adulthood. ..women are still subject to sexual harassment daily. Prior to this, when still with my family, circa 1955, I was out on the lawn with younger sister who was 3, I was 5.  A car pulled up, the passenger door opened and the man showed me a handful of candy and tried to get us into his car. Again...I did not know what it was about...all I knew is that he was DANGER. I grabbed sisters hand and ran off screaming nonstop like an alarm siren. He left...I never told anyone. I didn’t tell anyone about the time when our family doctor, during a physical to be cleared for the high school  basket ball team, placed his hand on my right breast and said “ Come back and see me when you’re brown as a berry !” (I tan dark). I was a virgin and didn’t know what sex was yet.... I didn’t tell anyone about this or a neighbours large son raping me at 16. We kept our mouths shut so we were not condemned as “sluts”. There were several more occurrences that I just left behind me for I refuse to live in fear. Seems that not much has changed. 3 months ago a drunk man at a local bus stop said ” I’m going to follow you home and fuck you stupid”. I took him out with one blow and I did not report it because I would be charged. He harassed me for 10 minutes prior to that statement- filth spilling from his ugly mouth. .. I’m 67 years of age now.

I was 14 and now I'm 50 and what happened to me by an extended family member still bothers me. There are so many triggers that bring back that fear to this day.

136598840398995_136851987040347,"As a girl growing up, it just seems to be open season. I can't even remember most of it!  An uncle who made sexual remarks all the time. I was scared was going to come into my room. He'd tell me sexual dreams he'd had about me naked, and who I later found out he had reached into my sister when she was naked showering and grabbed her tit. Older teenage boys yelling sexual remarks at me as I passed and telling me to 'get your knickers off and come over here'. A man shoved his penis up my arse as I bent over a museum exhibit when I was on a school trip as a young teen. (Men on buses all the time do that - don't imagine we think it's an umbrella!). Getting flashed at as a young teen in a park. Being targeted on a bus by a man (complete stranger) who said he was going to rape and kill me when I got off. I went to the bus driver and the man got off, but the bus got caught in traffic and when I got off in the deserted street, the man grabbed me and dragged me into a ditch and was trying to keep me there. I used every counselling tactic I know to keep him talking and diffuse the situation. I managed to get away but there was no where to go. It was an area of shops - all closed up at night. He followed me and I went into the only shop open which was a kebab shop. He followed me in. I asked to use their phone to call the police but the muslim men who owned it wouldn't let me. A young white girl who also worked there begged them to let me. I had no money (it was a pay phone). The girl gave me some money. I couldn't get the phone number of my boyfriend's shared house right - it kept going to an old lady. The man outside was telling the shop men that I was his wife and I had run away and he had a right to make me come back home with him.  The muslim men came into the back and started dragging me out and told me I had to go with my husband. The man took hold of me and started dragging me out again.  The girl started dragging me back. We got back to the phone and rang a police and a taxi. The muslim owners were haranguing me that i was shameful and should return to my husband. (And, apropos nothing, it was winter so I was covered from head to toe and in a big coat - so hey - no 'provacation'!)  The man only slipped away when the police van arrived.  The poor girl helping me was shaking like a leaf... The policeman in the van was pissed off that I insisted he drove me home.  He refused to take a statement or let me formally report it because 'it wasn't worth it' and then tried to drop me in the middle of the red light district where I would have to walk right through in the dark with the kerb crawlers. I point blank refused and made him take me home to the door, to his great disgust.",Dominique Kyle,,status,,2017-10-16 12:51:31,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0
